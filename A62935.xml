            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>Cavelier de La Salle,</hi> a Native of <hi>Roan</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> the chief Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the Diſcoveries in the <hi>Northern America,</hi> which make the Subject-Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Book, was a Man of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Parts, and undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. He was the firſt that formed the Deſign of Travelling from the Lake of <hi>Frontenac</hi> in <hi>Canada,</hi> to the Gulph of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98822:3"/>
                     <hi>Mexico,</hi> through a vaſt unknown Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in order to bring the Inhabitants to the Knowledge of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Extend the Dominions of the King of <hi>France.</hi> This Gentleman having duly weighed all the Difficulties that were like to croſs ſo Noble a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, came to Court to acquaint his Majeſty with it, who was pleaſed not only to approve his Enterprize, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to Encourage it, by the Liberal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and the Power he gave to M. <hi>La Salle,</hi> to diſpoſe of his New Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries as he ſhould think fit.</p>
                  <p>I was then at the Court of <hi>France</hi> to ſollicit ſome Employment, having ſerved his Majeſty both by Sea and Land, and loſt one Hand in <hi>Sicily</hi> by a Granado, and as M. <hi>La Salle</hi> was upon his departure, the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> was pleaſed to recommend me to him, as fit to accompany him in his Undertaking, whereupon I was eaſily admitted, the Patronage of His Highneſs having been very uſeful to M. <hi>La Salle.</hi> Every thing being ready for our departure, we ſet ſail from <hi>Rochel, July</hi> 14. 1678. to the number of 30 Men, amongſt whom were Pilots, Carpenters, Smiths and other uſeful Artiſts, and arrived at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98822:3"/>
                     <hi>Quebec</hi> upon the 15th of <hi>September</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; we remained there ſome days, after which having taken our Leave of Count <hi>Frontenac</hi> Governor-General of <hi>Canada,</hi> we ſailed up the River St. <hi>Laurence</hi> to Fort <hi>Frontenac,</hi> where we landed.</p>
                  <p>That Fort lyes within 120 Leagues from <hi>Quebec,</hi> about the 44th Degree of Latitude, on the Mouth of a Lake cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led likewiſe <hi>Frontenac</hi> or <hi>Ontario,</hi> which is near 300 Leagues about, and has a communication with four other Lakes, much of the ſame extent. All thoſe Lakes are Navigable, and plentifully ſtored with Fiſh; The Mouth, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of this Lake is defended by a Fort with four large Baſtions, which might protect a great number of Veſſels againſt the attempts of any Enemy. As M. <hi>La Salle</hi> had Erected this Fort, the King had given him the Propriety thereof, and of all the Lakes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts with their dependencies. The Country about it is ſo Charming, that it is impoſſible to deſcribe its Beauties: The vaſt Meadows are intermixed with Woods and Foreſts, full of all ſorts of Fruit-Trees, and watered with fine Brooks and Rivers.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98822:4"/>
                  <p>It was in this place that we prepared our ſelves for our great Voyage, and Glorious Undertaking, of which no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I am ſure, can give a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count than my ſelf, not only becauſe I accompanied the ſaid M. <hi>La Salle,</hi> but alſo becauſe the chief Care and Burthen of that Perilous, tho' Glorious Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, fell upon me by the untimely Death of that Gentleman. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which I offer now to the Publick, is extracted out of the Journal I kept, wherein I ſet down things as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me: 'Tis true, I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obliged to take things upon Truſt, becauſe I could not be always with M. <hi>La Salle,</hi> but I am ſo fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the Probity and Honeſty of thoſe upon whoſe Evidence I have advanced any thing, that I may anſwer as well for their Obſervations as for my own. The Reader muſt not therefore expect here Noble and Pompous Deſcriptions, ſuch as Authors uſe to adorn their Works with, but a natural ſimplicity, and a rigid fidelity. If my Stile ſeems harſh and unpolite, I have no other Apology for it, but that I may have contracted ſome thing from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98822:4"/>of the Savages of <hi>America,</hi> with whom I have ſo long converſed.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoever conſiders this Enterprize in it ſelf, the difficulties it was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and the advantages that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> may reap from the diſcovery of thoſe vaſt Countries, which are above eighteen hundred Leagues North and South, will I hope agree, that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act account thereof is worthy of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of the Reader.</p>

                  <p>The impatience I had to re-join M. <hi>la Salle</hi> with the fifteen Men I had brought back to their Duty, obliged me to make all the haſte poſſible, but the want of Proviſions, and the contrary Winds obliged us to land within Thirty Leagues of our Fort, where we found Acorns and ſome Staggs, wherewith we refreſhed our ſelves. My Men were ſo haraſſed, that I could never perſwade them to imbark again the ſame day, which obliged me to imbark alone with our Pilots, promiſing them to return ſpeedily. The Weather being very ſtormy, we ſpent ſix days before we could reach the Fort <hi>Miamis,</hi> where I gave an Account to M. <hi>la Salle</hi> of my Diſcoveries. He received me very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but told me withal, that he had been better pleaſed to ſee me arrived with all his Men.</p>
                  <p>Theſe laſt words ſeem'd to me a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and therefore after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed my ſelf, I went again into my Canoo, but I was hardly Fifteen Leagues off, that I was met by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Storm, in which our Canoo was overturned and then ſet to rights again, and at laſt driven upon the ſhore, from whence we went over Land to meet
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98822:15"/>our Men at the place appointed. We arrived there the next Morning, and having ſpent the reſt of the Day to get them together, embarked again, and came in leſs than one day to Fort <hi>Miamis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>M. <hi>la Salle</hi> was very glad to ſee his Men together, looking upon this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit as a neceſſary Supply to carry on his Deſigns, and yet theſe very Men diſappointed them, and ſome time after put an end to his Diſcoveries, and to his Life, ſo that the Men alone, upon whom he grounded his hopes, were the only cauſe of all the Misfortunes that befell him, and of the Tragical end of his Life.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>la Salle</hi> having in leſs than two Months put his Fort in a good poſture of Defence, as well to protect his Barks, and Canoos, as to defend himſelf againſt the Natives on the Land ſide, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the chief of the Nation into his Intereſts, reſolved to advance as far as the <hi>Illinois,</hi> whoſe neareſt Habitation was above 100 Leagues from our Fort.</p>

                     </note>The only way to go to them, was to Embark upon a River, which ſpringing from a Hill within ſix Leagues of the Lake of the <hi>Illinois,</hi> becomes Navigable above Forty Leagues from our Fort, and

The Banks of that River are as charming to the Eye, as uſeful for Life. The Meadows, Fruit-Trees, and Foreſts, affording every thing that is neceſſary for Men and Beaſts, ſo that being amuſed by that agreeable variety, we ſpent ſix days from the <hi>Portage</hi> (that is the place where we Embarked) to the firſt Village of the <hi>Illinois,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Village of the <hi>Illinois</hi>
                     </note> called <hi>Pontdalamia,</hi> conſiſting of above 500 Cabins, where we found no Inhabitants. We went aſhore, and viewed their Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins or Cottages, which are made with great pieces of Timber, interlac'd with Branches, and cover'd with Bark.

                  <p>We continued our Voyage, and above Thirty Leagues lower fell into a Lake or Pond above ſeven Leagues in Circuit, where we caught excellent Fiſh; and following the ſtream, fell again into the Channel of the River, and found our ſelves between two Bodies of Savages, who were Encamped on both ſides the River.

The <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linois</hi> obſerving our Countenance, and being naturally inclin'd to Peace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves to ask us, who we were? We anſwered by our Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that we were Subjects to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and come to make them know the Maſter of Heaven and Earth, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98822:17"/>offer them the Protection of our great Monarch; adding, that if they would put themſelves under his Protection, they ſhould live happily, and free from the Inſults of their Enemies. We told them beſides, that though their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was plentiful, they wanted Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to enjoy the Advantages of it, and therefore offer'd them our own, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they would have Commerce with us.

They expreſs'd as much as they could, their Veneration for our King; they preſented us the <hi>Calumet,</hi> the Signal or Badge of Peace among all thoſe Nations, as it has been already obſerved. They uſe the word of <hi>Singing</hi> or <hi>Dancing</hi> the <hi>Calumet.</hi> When they ſing it, they drive a Pole into the Ground, and every one brings in that place what he hath taken from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, of which they make a kind of Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and ſing about it their Warlike Expeditions and glorious Feats.

                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:98822:17"/>
                  <p>We anſwer'd their Ceremonies and Complements by all the demonſtrations of Joy we could think on, and ſome Preſents as tokens of our Friendſhip. We told them, that Neceſſity had forc'd us to take ſome <hi>Indian</hi> Corn out of their Village,<note place="margin">They enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us.</note> for which we gave them ſome Toys and Brandy. This Convinc'd them of our Sincerity, and ſending for their Wives and Children, made prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to entertain us with all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity and Magnificence they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, with Beef and Stag, and all ſorts of Veniſon and Fowls. We were very liberal on our ſide of our Brandy; ſo that the Feaſt laſted three whole days; during which, we made ſeveral Diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our Arms, at which they were frighted, but our good Words and kind Expreſſions confirmed them in the good Opinion they had of us. The familiar Titles of Brothers, Friends, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades were not forgotten; and even ſome of us were Adopted into the chief Families amongſt them; ſo that through the natural Inconſtancy of the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> we diſcover'd in the <hi>Illinois,</hi> a great Humanity, and a good diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Civil Society.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Character of the <hi>Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois.</hi>
                     </note>They are naturally Careſſing, Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and Complaiſant, but on the other ſide Cunning, and dexterous at all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. They are generally ſpeaking well ſhaped, ſtrong, and of a brown or tawny Complexion. Hunting is their great Delight, which makes them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docible. They love Women with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and Boys above Women, ſo that they become by that horrid Vice, very effeminate. 'Tis obſervable however, that notwithſtanding that vitious Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they have ſeveral Laws to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh that infamous Vice. For as ſoon as a Boy has proſtituted himſelf, he is degraded in a manner of his Sex, being forbidden to wear the Apparel or Name of Man, and to make any Office or Function fit for Men, even nor ſo much as to be ſuffered to go a Hunting. They are therefore look'd upon as Women, and confin'd to their Employments, of whom they are even more ſlighted and hated than by Men; inſomuch that theſe Wretches become, by their Crime, the ſcorn and contempt of both Sexes. Thus without any help but natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they are ſenſible of their Crime, and have made theſe Laws as a Bridle to maſter their brutiſh ſenſuality, tho',
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98822:18"/>as I have ſaid before, they hate all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reſtraint; they marry ſeveral Wives, and to preſerve Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their Families, they marry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Siſters or near Relations. They are very Jealous, and puniſh the Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their Wives with a great ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Hermaphrodite</hi> are very common amongſt them, but whether it be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Climate or no, I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to determine. Women, and the proſtituted Boys I have ſpoken of, work fine Mats for hanging their Cottages, while Men go a Hunting or till the Ground for ſowing of <hi>Indian</hi> Corn. Their Country is ſituated along the River, which bears their Name, and are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed in ſeveral Villages. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains about 1500 Souls, amongſt whom we computed 500 fighting Men.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>La Salle</hi> being ſenſible of the ſtrength of this Nation, thought that nothing was to be neglected to keep them in amity with us; but at the ſame time that it was neceſſary to provide our ſelves againſt their Inconſtancy.<note place="margin">A Fort built.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ordered a Fort to be built upon a riſing ground near the River, which was in a little time in a poſture of defence. However he was in great pain for his

This, together with the malice of ſome of our Men, made him ſo melancholy, that the Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Face betrayed the grief of his Heart; but as he was very Couragious, he concealed it as well as poſſible, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himſelf to manifeſt it by the Name of <hi>Crevecoeur</hi> (breaking Heart) which he gave to his Fort.</p>
                  <p>We had however hitherto no great cauſe of Complaint; we had happily carried on our Diſcovery to 500 Leagues beyond Fort <hi>Frontenac,</hi> and made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Forts for the Communication and Security of our Settlements. Moſt of the Savages were entred into our Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the fierceſt among them, had not ſo much as offer'd to ſtop our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, ſo that we found no Enemies but our ſelves, and our own Diviſions, which proved at laſt a fatal ſource of great Misfortunes and Miſeries.</p>

What ſaid they? muſt we always be Slaves to his <hi>Caprichio's,</hi> and be continually bubbl'd by his Viſions, and fooliſh Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? and muſt the Fatigues we have hitherto undergone be uſed as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to oblige us to go through more Perils, to gratifie the Ambition or Folly of a mercileſs Man, who upon fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences has tranſplanted us into this new World amongſt Brutes.

Theſe were the Arguments theſe Villains uſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage themſelves to the horrid Crime they had reſolved upon; but having, upon ſecond thoughts, conſidered the conſequences of their violent Deſigns, they thought it would be more ſafe to incite the <hi>Illinois</hi> againſt him, that he might periſh by their Hands.</p>

They told them that M. <hi>La Salle</hi> was in a ſtrict Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> their ancient and implacable Enemies; that he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into their Country to diſcover their Situation and Strength; that the Fort he had built was to bridle them; and that the Voyage he pretended to

                           <hi>I</hi> Cannot but wonder at your Inconſtancy; we parted very good Friendſ laſt Night, and this Morning I find you almoſt in Arms againſt me; no body ſpeaks to me, and every body threatens me: What new Crime have I committed? or rather by what new Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor have you been incenſed againſt me? I ſurrender my ſelf, and therefore if ever I have acted againſt the Intereſt of your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you may do what you pleaſe, I am at your mercy. <hi>The Savages conſidering his Speech, and his Countenance, were almoſt perſwaded with his Innocence, and told him the Subject of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie

                     <hi>Mauſolea</hi> had certainly no Proof, but endeavoured to make out his Accuſation by ſome Circumſtances; as his former Commerce with the <hi>Iroquois;</hi> the Fort he had built upon the River of the <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linois;</hi> and his return to Fort <hi>Frontenac,</hi> concluding that though theſe were no direct Proofs, yet they were ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Indications of his Deſign.

The place M. <hi>la Salle</hi> had pitched upon, was a Rock very high, the top of which was even and of a convenient ſpace, ſo that it commanded the River, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try round about.<note place="margin">Our Fort Plunder'd.</note> I had already drawn ſome Lines, and made other preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to build it, when I heard that theſe Villains had ſeduc'd and perverted moſt

I confeſs my Heart was almoſt broke, when I conſider'd the Condition we were in, without any help amongſt Savages; but having found a good quantity of Ammunition, with Arms left in the Fort, I thought the Cauſe was not altogether Deſperate, and encouraged my Men, by the hopes of a quick return of M. <hi>La Salle,</hi> and all other Arguments that I could think on, not forgetting the glory they had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Fidelity, and the Reward they might expect, if they ſupported this Diſgrace with Courage. I took an exact Account of the Dammage we had ſuſtained, and ſent it to M. <hi>La Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le.</hi> I redoubled in the mean time my care and application to preſerve our Correſpondence with the <hi>Illinois,</hi> and by theſe means we put our ſelves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near in as good a poſture as before, the number of Men excepted.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>La Salle</hi> having received theſe

                     </note> for in the Month of <hi>September</hi> 1687, we diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red within a quarter of a League of the Camp of the <hi>Illinois,</hi> about 600 <hi>Iroquois</hi> armed with Bows, Swords, Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds, and a great many of them with Fire-arms. This unexpected Army frighted the <hi>Illinois,</hi> and revived their ſuſpicion of our Correſpondence with their Enemies; and I muſt confeſs, I was in a great perplexity, knowing not what to do in ſo nice a juncture.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98822:27"/>whatever I could to encourage the <hi>Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi> and told them that I would go to the Camp of the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring them to Terms; aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, that if I could not ſucceed, I would ſhare the danger they were in; but that they had no time to loſe, and therefore advis'd them to ſend their Women and Children away, and put themſelves in good poſture of defence. This Propoſal convinc'd them of the ſincerity of our Intentions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they gave me an Interpreter, and one of their chief Men to accompany me, and be Witneſs of my Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The Army of the <hi>Iroquois</hi> divided into two Bodies, and commanded by <hi>Tagancourte,</hi> Chief of <hi>Tſonnontouans,</hi> and <hi>Agouſtot</hi> Chief of the <hi>Deſouatages,</hi> two experienc'd Generals.

                  <p>The conſideration of the danger I had eſcaped, Cured me almoſt of my Wound, and gave me ſufficient ſtrength to return to our Camp.

                  <p>Being thus forſaken by our new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, we retir'd into our Fort, but the <hi>Illinois</hi> being re-inforced by freſh Men, appeared again two days after, upon a riſing ground in good Order, and reſolved to fight; whereupon the <hi>Iroquois</hi> thinking they were more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than at firſt, and having tryed their Valour in the former Attack, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fir'd me to interpoſe my mediation for a Peace, which I accepted; and they gave me one of their Chiefs as an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtage.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98822:30"/>I went to the <hi>Illinois</hi> with Father <hi>Zenoble,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties accept my media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and told them the Propoſals of the <hi>Iroquois;</hi> and that I had brought one of their Chiefs for Hoſtage.

Both Parties being ſo well diſpoſed, I took ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and returned to the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> whom I told that I was empowered to treat with them, and deſir'd that we might immediately enter upon the Treaty.</p>

                     </note>They were pleaſed with it, and the Hoſtage of the <hi>Illinois</hi> being arrived at the ſame time, confirmed every thing that I had ſaid, ſo that the Treaty would have been concluded in few Hours, had not the Imprudence of this <hi>Illinois</hi> broken all my meaſures. This inconſiderate Fellow began to praiſe the Valour of his own Nation, and their Generals; but owned, that being hardly 400 Men, they lookt upon their Propoſals of Peace as a favour, which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98822:31"/>they would acknowledge by ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of Beavers and Slaves. This foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Confeſſion undeceived the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> who having believed what I had told them of the number of the <hi>Illinois,</hi> were glad to make Peace, and in ſome fear of their Enemies. They began then to ſpeak very big, and complained in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard words, I had deluded them, and done them a great injury, ſaying that they would have got a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Booty, if they had not believed me.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs I was put to a plunge, but having recovered my ſelf, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, That what I had ſaid before, and what, the <hi>Illinois</hi> ſaid then was true, for the <hi>Illinois</hi> were above 600 Men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Arrival, and at the firſt fight, but that a great number having deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince that time, it may be that their Number was reduced to 400. That I had no other intention but to bring both Parties to a right underſtanding: That they were Maſters of the Camp of their Enemies, and might impoſe upon them what Conditions they pleaſed, ſince they offer'd themſelves to buye the Peace. They approved, or at leaſt ſeemed to approve my Reaſons, and

                  <p>When we ſaw our ſelves ſafe, Father <hi>Zenoble</hi> and I made ſeveral Reflections, on the Diſſimulation and Infidelity of that Nation, and likewiſe on the dangers we had been expoſed to in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and I remember that that good Father blam'd my proceedings; and ſaid, That in thoſe nice occaſions, we ought to be more pliant, in hopes to find a more favourable opportunity. I agreed with him in general, but inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this Principle admitted of ſome exceptions, and that aſſuredneſs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour were more prevailing upon bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous men, than a more prudent way.

Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Zenoble</hi> and I advanced into the Woods to look for him, but could not diſcover what was become of him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we fir'd our Arms, and made all the Night long a great Fire to give him notice of the place where we expected him. We underſtood ſince, that he was met by a Band of Savages called <hi>Quicapous,</hi> who murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98822:34"/>him, and ſold, ſome time after, his Breviary to a Jeſuit, from whom we learned theſe particulars. Thus dyed this Holy Man, in the ſeventieth Year of his Age, by the Hands of thoſe very Men for the ſake of whom he had left his Native Country, and ſuffer'd ſo many Fatigues.</p>
                  <p>We waited for him 'till the next day about Noon, but having no hopes of his Return, we Embarked again, and after one Months Navigation, land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within two days Journey of the Lake of the <hi>Illinois,</hi> into which we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried over Land our Equipage. We em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked again on the 20th of <hi>October,</hi> and ten days after, were forced to land, by contrary Winds, within 20 Leagues of a great Village, called <hi>Potavalamia,</hi> where we found no other Proviſions but Acorns.</p>
                  <p>I was ſick of an Ague, and my legs were ſo ſwoln, that we could not reach the Village I have ſpoken of 'till the 10th of <hi>November.</hi> We found no body in it, nor any Proviſions, but having, by good chance, advanced into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we met with a good quantity of <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, which enabled us to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark again. The Winds were ſo croſs,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98822:34"/>that we were oblig'd to come a, Shore few days, after, where having found ſome freſh foot-ſteps, we, followed the Track, and came to another Village of the <hi>Pontoualamis,</hi> which was likewiſe abandoned, but however afforded us ſome Proviſions, which were ſufficient to maintain us 'till our arrival at the Buy of <hi>Puans,</hi> which; was towards the latter end of <hi>November.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having already deſcribed this Bay, I need not repeat it now, but I muſt add, that there is a Creek in it called the Creek of the Sturgeons, becauſe of the prodigious quantity of that, ſort of Fiſh that is catch'd in it. We refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves in that place for ſeveral days with the <hi>Pontoualamis,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained us with ſcorched Beeſ and Stagg. We diverted alſo our ſelves in Hunting of Beavers, which afforded us a great ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The Country about the Bay, being watered by an infinite number of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets, lined with great Trees, and the Woods being full of Aſpen-trees, the Branches and Leaves whereof are the dainty food of Beavers. Thoſe Creatures are very numerous in thoſe Parts.</p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:98822:35"/>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">An Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couns of Beavers.</note>The Beavers are, as every body knows, Amphibious, Creatures, who cannot live without Air, Water, and Land. They are near as big as Sheep, but not so tall, their legs being very ſhort, but ſo nimble, that they come nothing ſhort of Apes for dexterity. They have a Muzzle or Noſe, and ſtrong Teeth; their Body is covered with thick Hair, and pretty fine, but their Tail is made up of a kind of twiſted Hair, Which forms a figure like that of a Triangle, and ſerves them as a Trowel to beat the ſoft Earth they make uſe of to build their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations.</p>
                  <p>The Inſtinct or Induſtry of thoſe Creatures is almoſt incredible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am ſenſible that many will que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the Truth of what I have to ſay about it, however, I may aſſure the Reader that I do not Romance in the leaſt. When they have a mind to make a new Settlement or Habitation, and have found a proper place for it, which is commonly in the Channel of a: Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, provided it be not too deep, or too broad, they look for a Tree on the Bank of the ſaid River, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little towards the Water. They
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98822:35"/>meet together in a Circle, and becauſe their number is always odd, it ſeems that they hold a Council, to know what is fit to be done. The firſt thing to be done, is to cut down the Tree they have pitched upon, but not hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontaly, but in ſuch a manner that it may fall into the very place they have a mind to, that is croſs the River, to ſtop, or at lead to abate the Rapidity of the ſtream. If the Branches hinder the body of the Tree to lye in die Water. they cut them likewiſe, and then make a perfect Dike or Bank with Mud and Gravel together, leaving now and then ſome places open for the Water, leſt the River ſhould overflow their Bank. If the Tree cannot reach the other Shore, they fell another Tree over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it to join that, and make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Cauſey or Bridge. This Work being compleated, they build their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations or Caves near that place, and employ nothing but mud in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner; they lay a Lay of it, and beat it very hard with their Tails, and then another, and ſo on ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 'till it is about three Foot high; they Arch it and Poliſh it very handſomly, and divide it into three ſeveral Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentſ,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98822:36"/>which have communication one with the other; one of them is to lie in, the ſecond for their Proviſions, and the third ſerves them for a neceſſary Houſe. They make a Canal or ſubterranean Aqueduct from the River to one of their Apartments, in which they have a kind of Pond, wherein they hold their Tail, for otherwiſe they could not live. This Canal ſerves alſo for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother uſe, for when they hear any noiſe, they make their eſcape through that place into the River. Every one is obliged to work, but if any one has his Tail excoriated or other wiſe hurt, he lays it flat upon his back, to ſhew that he is unable to work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How they Hunt Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note>When the Savages go a Hunting, they follow the Rivers, and as ſoon as they diſcover any Cauſey, Bridge or Bank, they may be ſure that the Beavers are not far off. They come as near as they can, but as ſoon as the Beavers ſee or hear them, they run through their Canal into the River; but as they muſt breath from time to time, the Savages ſoon ſhoot them, if it be in Summer time; for in Winter they uſe another Art to catch them. They make holes in the Ice and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98822:36"/>beat out the Beavers from their Habitations into the River, they muſt come to breath through thoſe Holes, and then the Savages catch them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live by the Tail.</p>
                  <p>Having refreſhed our ſelves above Ten Days in this place, and taken in Proviſions, we Embarked again on the Seventeenth of <hi>December</hi> for <hi>Miſſilima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinac,</hi> but eight days after were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back by a contrary Wind. The Savages were gone away, but had left ſome Proviſions, which we wanted ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much; for the Ice and the malady of our Men obliged us to continue in that place, where we ſuffer'd very much. Finding our ſelves in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, I advanced into the Woods to endeavour to find ſome relief, and it pleaſed God that I met with two Savages, of the Nation of the <hi>Outno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas,</hi> who conducted me to a Village belonging to the <hi>Pontoualamis,</hi> where we met ſeveral <hi>French</hi>-men ſetled in that place, by whom we were kindly receiv'd, as alſo by the Savages. Father <hi>Zenoble</hi> underſtanding that the Jeſuits had a Settlement in the bottom of the Bay, thought it was more becoming his Character, to paſs the Winter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98822:37"/>them, than in company of the Savages, and went thither two days after our arrival; but we continued 'till the next Spring in that place, and liv'd very comfortably.</p>
                  <p>We diverted bur ſelves at Hunting wild Bulls in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How they Hunt Bulls.</note> the Graſs being already grown. Thoſe Bulls are near twice as big as ours, the Hair looks like a fine Fleece, and is very long; their Horns are bent backwards, and extraordinary long; their Eyes are likewiſe larger and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than thoſe of our <hi>European</hi> Bulls, which make them look terrible. They go always by Droves of three or four Hundred in each. When the Savages go a Hunting, they encompaſs a Drove of theſe Bulls, and one of them comes creeping as near as he can, and then ſtands up, making an Out-cry, which frightens away the whole Drove; the Savages being in a Circle, they cannot eſcape without being ſhot; but as they become very fierce and dangerous when they are wounded, the Savages ſhoot them in the Thigh or the Shoulder, to prevent their coming upon them, and when they are down, they break their Heads with Clubs. As they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98822:37"/>Markſmen, they never miſs, and twenty Men will ſometimes kill Forty and Fifty Bulls.</p>
                  <p>That which is wonderful in this, is the havock, which the Shot ſent by the Savages makes; for beſides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs and ſwiftneſs of the Stroke, the force of it is very ſurprizing, and ſo much the rather, becauſe it is nothing elſe but a Stone, or a Bone, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a piece of very hard Wood, pointed and faſtned to the end of an Arrow with ſome Fiſhes-glue, that cauſes this terrible effect. When the Savages go to War, they poiſon the Point, or extremity of their Dart, ſo that if that remains in the Body, Death follows of neceſſity; the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in this caſe, is to draw out the Arrow through the other ſide of the Wound; if it goes quite thorough, or if not, to make an aperture on the other ſide, and ſo to draw it through; after which they know by inſtinct, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Herbs, the application of which both draws out the Venom, and Cures 'em.</p>
                  <p>I ſtayed all the Month of <hi>March</hi> in this place: Father <hi>Zenoble</hi> came back to me at Spring, and we re-embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98822:38"/>at the Creek we had left, came to Land at <hi>Miſſilimachinac</hi> in the begining of <hi>April,</hi> with a deſign to ſtay there for M. <hi>de la Salle.</hi> From the 11th of <hi>September,</hi> 1681, when we took our leaves of the <hi>Illinois,</hi> to the 1ſt of <hi>April,</hi> Seven Months were ſlipt away; during which time, M. <hi>de la Salle,</hi> upon the Advice that I had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by my Letter, was come down to the <hi>Illinois</hi> with a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit, with intention to help us. The <hi>Iroquois</hi> having Advice of his Deſcent, and being afraid of being hemm'd in between two Armies, were retired, and, the <hi>Illinois</hi> were again entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Poſſeſſions. However M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> found but ſome few, the reſt being gone to winter in the Woods; he exhorted thoſe that remained, to call their Country-men, aſſuring them he would build a Fort that ſhould ſhelter them from the Invaſion of their Enemies;<note place="margin">The Fort of <hi>Creve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coeur</hi>
                     </note> he viſited the Fort of <hi>Crevecoeur,</hi> which was ſtrill in the ſame condition, and placed therein a ſmall Garriſon of Fifteen or Sixteen <hi>French,</hi> and a Commander, with Ammunition and Arms. After this, he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain up the River to the great Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98822:38"/>whither many Families of the <hi>Illinois</hi> were returned; he laboured hard upon the incloſure of his New Fort, and having underſtood by ſome Scouts, that I had taken my way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Miſſilimachinac,</hi> he ſet forward again to join me, having left ſome Soldiers and Pioneers at the intended Fort, to continue his Work and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that Poſt.</p>
                  <p>He came not to <hi>Miſſilimachinac</hi> 'till about the Fifteenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the Year 1682. There we took new mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to perfect the Diſcovery we had begun. We muſt needs think forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with of making ſome new Proviſion for ſo long a Voyage. It was with this Deſign, that after Six Days reſt, M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> ſet out in a Canoo for <hi>Fronte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,</hi> Father <hi>Zenoble</hi> and I going along with him; haying ſailed happily the firſt day, we landed at a Village cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Trejagou,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Iroquois.</hi> M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> Traficked there with ſome Skins, and having ordered me to ſtay for him there, with Father <hi>Zenoble,</hi> he went on board the <hi>Canoo Frontenac.</hi> There he found his Bark ready, and ſtored her with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Ammunition and Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;

                  <p>The Rivers being ſtill block'd up with Ice, we found our ſelves oblig'd to begin again our Journey by Land; the Third day of <hi>January,</hi> 1683. we had puſht on our way to Thirty Leagues below. There the Weather grew mild, and the Ice melted, ſo that Navigation appearing commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, we went on Board a Canoo, the Twenty Fourth of <hi>January,</hi> and fell down the River or the <hi>Illinois,</hi> to the River <hi>Miſſiſſipi,</hi> where we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſecond of <hi>February.</hi>

Not to Uſurp their Territories, but put them in a way to Cultivate and Improve them, and to inſtruct them in our Commerce. In ſhort, not to become their Lords and Matters, but
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98822:46"/>to Eſtabliſh a Brotherly Friendſhip with them.</p>
                  <p>The Prince all this while hearken'd with great Attention, (and one of our <hi>Abenaguis</hi> having given him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what I ſaid) embraced me, and with a ſmiling Countenance, told me, That after the Account I had given him of our great Monarch, he could not but conceive the greateſt Reſpect and Veneration for him; that he ſhould the next day ſee M. <hi>de la Salle,</hi> and that he would give him more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular aſſurances of it. Whereupon I preſented him in M. <hi>de la Salle</hi>'s Name, with a Sword inlaid with Gold and Silver, ſome Caſes of Razors, Cizars, and Knives, and ſome Bottles of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua vitae.</hi> I cannot expreſs the Joy and ſatisfaction he receiv'd theſe ſmall Preſents with. But I took notice at the ſame time, that one of his Wives, who had a pair of the Cizars in her Hand, admir'd very much the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Work, and would now and then give me a Smile, which I fancied might be a modeſt way of asking me for a pair too. I took an opportunity to draw near to her, and pulling out of my Pocket a ſmall ſteel
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98822:46"/>Caſe of Filligreen-work, wherein was a pair of Cizars, and a little Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe-ſhell Knife, and pretending to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the whiteneſs and fineneſs of her Garment, I ſlipt the Caſe into her Hand, and ſhe received it, ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Hand pretty hard. Which gave me reaſon to think, that theſe Women have not Hearts altogether ſo Savage, but that they might eaſily be tamed by us, and taught the Politer Arts of Converſation. Another of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who was not leſs pretty, and neatly accoutred, drawing nearer to us, gave me to underſtand by the Thorns ſhe ſhewed me, which ſhe made uſe of to faſten her Train, that ſome Pins would be very acceptable to her. I gave her a paper of 'em, together with a Caſe of Needles and a Silver Thimble. Theſe little Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets ſhe received with a wonderful joy; and then I gave as much to the two others. She who was the fineſt and the moſt agreeable of 'em, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken notice that I admir'd a Collar of large Pearl that ſhe had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her Neck, took it off, and made an Offer of it to me, with abundance of civility. I refus'd it a good while,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98822:47"/>but reflecting upon the plenty of Pearls that is among them, and that the fiſhing for 'em was in the Seas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, I made no further difficulty, and after a few more offers, I accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it. But, in return, I gave her ten Yards of Blew Ribbon, which ſhe valued, at leaſt, at as high a rate.</p>
                  <p>The Night now drawing on, I was going to take my leave of the Prince, but he very earneſtly deſired me to ſtay 'till the next day, and gave the charge of me to an Officer, to let me want for nothing. I did not want much Courtſhip, and the deſire I had to ſee a little of their Manners and Behaviour, made me readily enough accept of the kind offer. I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into an Apartment furniſhed much after the rate of that the Prince was in. There they brought me a Collation of Wild-fowl, and Fruit, and ſome Liquors, of which I taſted. All that while there was an Old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with me, who was very good Company, and eſpecially becauſe he reſolved me all the Queſtions I put to him. As for what concerns their Politicks, he inform'd me, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98822:47"/>govern'd by their Prince's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Will. That they obey'd him as their Soveraign; that they own'd his Children his lawful Succeſſors; that when he died, they ſacrificed his firſt or Chief Wife, the firſt Steward and twenty Men of his Nation, to be his Retinue and wait upon him in the other World. That during his Life, no Man drunk in his Cup, nor eat out of his Diſh, or walk'd as he was paſſing by; that care was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taken, not only to clean the Way for him, but alſo to ſtrew it with ſweet Herbs and Flowers. I obſerv'd in that little time I was in his Preſence, that when he ſpoke to any body, they made a loud kind of humming before they anſwer'd him; and I'begg'd this Old Gentleman to tell me the Reaſon of it: He told me that this was lookt upon as a token of admiration and reſpect. As to their Religion, he told me that they Worſhip the Sun; that they had their Temples, their Altars, and their Prieſts. That in that Temple, there was a Fire which burnt perpetually, as the proper Emblem of the Sun.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98822:48"/>That at the Decreaſe of the Moon, they carried a great Diſh of their greateſt Dainties to the Door of the Temple, as an Oblatory Sacrifice; which the Prieſts offer'd to their God, and then they carried it home, and feaſted themſelves with it.</p>
                  <p>As to their Cuſtoms, every Spring they go in a Body to ſome retir'd place, and there turn up a large ſpace of Land, which they do with the Drums beating all the while. After this, they take care to call it the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart,</hi> or the <hi>Field of the Spirit.</hi> And thither they go in good earneſt, when they are in their Enthuſiaſtick Fits, and there wait for Inſpiration from their pretended Deity. In the mean while, as they do this every Year, it proves of no ſmall advantage to them, for by this means they turn up all their Land inſenſibly, and it becomes abundantly more fruitful. In Autumn they gather their <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, and they keep it in great Baskets 'till the New Moon in the next Month of <hi>June:</hi> Then the Families get to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and every one invites his Friends
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98822:48"/>and Neighbours, to come and eat Cakes, and ſome Meat they get like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and thus they ſpend the Day in Feaſting.</p>
                  <p>This is all I could learn that Day of their Religion, their Government and Cuſtoms. The next Day I had the Curioſity of ſeeing their Temple, and the Old Gentleman had me thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Structure of it was exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame with that of the Prince's Houſe. As to the out-ſide, it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with a great high Wall, the ſpace betwixt that and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple forming a kind of Court, where People may walk. On the top of the Wall are ſeveral Pikes to be ſeen, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which are ſtuck the Heads of their own moſt notorious Criminals, or of their Enemies. On the top of the Frontiſpiece, there is a great Knob raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all covered round with Hair, and above that, an heap of Scalps in form of a Trophy.</p>
                  <p>The inſide of the Temple is only a <hi>Nave,</hi> painted on all ſides, at top with all ſorts of Figures; in the midſt of it is an Hearth inſtead of an Altar, upon
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98822:49"/>which there is continually three great Billets burning, ſtanding up on end; and two Prieſts dreſt in White Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are ever looking after it, to make up the Fire and ſupply it. It is round this that all the People come to ſay their Prayers, with ſtrange kind of Hummings. The Prayers are three times a Day; at Sun riſe, at Noon, and at Sun ſet. They made me take notice of a ſort of Cloſet cut out of the Wall, the inſide of which was very fine: I could ſee only the Roof of it, on the top of which there hung a couple of ſpread Eagles, which look'd towards the Sun. I wanted to go into it; but they told me that it was the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of their God, and that it was permitted to none but their High Prieſt to go into it. And I was told that this was the Repoſitory of their Wealth and Treaſures; as Pearls, Gold and Silver, precious Stones, and ſome Goods that came out of <hi>Europe,</hi> which they had from their Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>After I had ſeen all theſe Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I took my leave of all thoſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98822:49"/>that were with me, and went back with my two Interpreters, to M. <hi>de la Salle;</hi> to whom I gave a faithful Account of the good Entertainment I had received from the Prince of the <hi>Tacucas;</hi> of his Magnificence, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of his good Inclinations to acknowledge the King's Authority. Some time after we ſaw him coming towards us, in a very magnificent Barge, with Drums beating, and the Women that attended him playing on ſeveral Inſtruments: Some of them were in his own Barge, ſome in others that went along by the ſide of it. M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> received him in a reſpectful manner, and yet with that gravity as beſt became him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Character he bore. He thanked him for the honour he did him, and told him he did not receive it but in the Name of the Prince his Maſter; and that as he did not doubt but he was willing to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Power, ſo he might ſafely aſſure him of his Royal Friendſhip and Protection. The Prince of the <hi>Tacuca</hi>'s made Anſwer, That what he had heard of the Grandure of the <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:98822:50"/>King, and of the Valour of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, would not permit him to heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, in paying him in Perſon the Hommage which he was perſwaded was due to him whom he repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that tho' he was a Soveraign, he chearfully ſubmitted to our great King's Power; and that he ſhould be glad to merit our Alliance and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection by his Services. After theſe mutual Proteſtations of Friendſhip, they made each other their Preſents. M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> preſented him with two pieces of Ribbon, and ſome Trinkets for his Wives. The Prince gave him ſix of his richeſt Robes, a Collar of Pearl, a <hi>Piroque</hi> or Barge filled with Ammunition and Proviſion; after which, there was brought a Dozen of Bottles of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> prepar'd with Sugar and Almonds, and Apricock Kernels. Then the King's Health was drunk, with a diſcharge of all our Guns, after that of the Prince of the <hi>Tacuca</hi>'s in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; after which he went again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <hi>Piroque,</hi> and went away very well ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>We continued all that Day on that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98822:50"/>Shore, where we took the Altitude, and found our ſelves at the 25th Degree of Latitude, the next day being the 22d of <hi>March</hi> 1693, we went and lay ten Leagues off</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> perceiving a <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roque,</hi> that made up towards us, to ſee what we were, gave me or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to chaſe it; which I did; but as I was juſt going to lay hold of her, above a Hundred Men ſtraight appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Shore, with their Bows ready to ſhoot us. M. <hi>de la Salle,</hi> with loud calling after me, made me ſtop; and being come back to his Company again, we went all and ſtood over againſt them with our Muskets ready preſented. This poſture of ours frighted them, and made them lay down their Arms; and I was immediately ordered to go and carry them the <hi>Calumet.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come up to them, I offer'd them the Collar of Peace; they accepted it very civilly; they embraced me, and gave me to underſtand, that they would be Friends with us. M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> ſeeing in what an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98822:51"/>manner they had received me, came to join us on the ſame Shore; and as ſoon as thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages perceived him to be our Chief, they paid him all kind, of Honours and Reſpect. He told them that he did not require any thing from them, but a chearful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and Submiſſion to our great King's Orders; to which he added, for their encouragement, the Example of the other greater Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and made uſe of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he before uſed on like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. They anſwer'd him, that they had their Prince, and that they could determine nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Orders, and offer'd either to bring him to us, or to conduct, us to his Dwelling. M. <hi>de la Salle,</hi> who was always glad of an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſeeing the Situation, Manners, and Faculty of thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, choſe the latter. Their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage was four great Leagues off from the Shore. We were no ſooner come into it, but the Prince came to receive us; he had us into his Cottage, where he treated us very
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98822:51"/>handſomly, it was the Prince of the Nation of the <hi>Naches.</hi> This People is divided into two Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; this was the leaſt of the two. Their Territories are ſeldom above Twenty Leagues compaſs, and their greateſt Revenues is the Pearl Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhery which they have in the Sea about them.</p>
                  <p>There is a great many Divers of that Nation, who dive to the bottom of the Water, and fetch up theſe precious Shells from the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of the Rocks. On a fair day you may ſee the Shells on the Rocks open themſelves to receive the Dew of Heaven. Which Dew breeds the firſt Seeds of the Pearl within the Shells, which appear like little white Grain that ſticks faſt to the Shell. Theſe ſmall ſoft Grains do in time become hard and white, as we ſee they are. It is obſerved that the Pearls which are fetch'd from the bottom of the Sea, are fairer than thoſe which are found on the Rocks, becauſe the Sun
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98822:52"/>tarniſhes theſe, and the Thunder is deſtructive to their Seeds.</p>
                  <p>This little Prince preſented M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> with ſome Dozens of 'em, of a conſiderable bigneſs; and in return, we gave him a Hatchet, a Kettle, and ſome Knives. They gave us beſides theſe, ſome Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and having ſtaid there the whole Day, we went away the next very well ſatisfied with each other. They gave us a couple of Guides, to ſhew us the way into the other Nation of the ſame Name, which is Ten Leagues farther in the Country. In the mean time M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> ſent two of our Men to carry ſome freſh Proviſions to thoſe that waited for us by the Water ſide, together with Orders to fall Ten Leagues lower down the River, and to ſtay for him there.</p>
                  <p>Thus we went under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our Guides, and came that Night to the great Village of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> This Nation is able to ſet
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98822:52"/>out Three Thouſand Men in any time of War. Their Land is very well Cultivated, and bears <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, all ſorts of Fruit-Trees, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live-trees, and Vines. There are vaſt Meadows to be ſeen there; vaſt Foreſts and all ſorts of Cattle; Fiſhing and Hunting being all their Employment and their Wealth.</p>
                  <p>The Prince received us with a great deal of Joy; made us a great many Preſents both of Pearl and Proviſions, and treated us very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly. The next day we plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there the King's Arms, giving a Volley of Shot; after which we took our leaves of the Prince, who aſſured us of his intire Submiſſion; and we went to meet our Men with new Proviſions.</p>
                  <p>Being got aboard our Canoos, we went forward, and about Eight Leagues off, we came to the Village <hi>Coroas,</hi> where the Prince receiv'd us as the reſt had done, and paid Homage.</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:98822:53"/>
                  <p>The next day being the 27th of <hi>March,</hi> 1683. we planted our Huts at the Mouth of a great River, which comes from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and is called <hi>La Sablonniere;</hi> Ten Leagues from hence, as we continued our Courſe, we found the River di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it ſelf into three Channels; I took the Right-hand-ſtream, M. <hi>de la Foreſt</hi> took the left, and M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> the middle way; we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed each our Courſe for about Ten Leagues, and in a little time after, we ſound our ſelves re-join'd by the uniting of the Three Streams again into one. We were hardly got together again, and gone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Five or Six Leagues, but we eſpied ſome Fiſher-men by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſide, who were <hi>Quinipiſſa's.</hi> As ſoon as they ſaw us come near, they allarmed all the teſt of their Men, and ſtraight the Drum fell a beating, and the Shore was in an inſtant lined with Savages, all armed with Bows and Arrows; we were willing to ſend Four <hi>French</hi> Men to treat with 'em, but they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98822:53"/>were ſeverely ſent back by a ſhole of Arows; after which, four of our Savages offer'd to go to ſee what they could do, but they were uſed in like manner; in ſo much that M. <hi>de la Salle,</hi> not willing to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further riſque here, he bid us leave them in quiet, and trouble our ſelves no further with them.</p>
                  <p>Twelve Leagues from the <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipiſſa</hi>'s, we fell to the Right, on the Village call'd <hi>Tangibao;</hi> we found it pillag'd, ſack'd, and a great Heap of dead Bodies one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another. This ſight ſtruck a mighty honour in us, and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was not good ſtaying there, we went on; and about Ten Leagues further, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to find the Water brackiſh; the Shore ſeemed ſomewhat more extended, and all ſtrewed with Shells of different ſhape and figure, ſome like drinking Cups, ſome like Snails ending in a ſpiral point, and all of a moſt agreeable varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Colours. We kept on ſtill, and alter an Hours failing, we put
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98822:54"/>our ſelves into a Canoo, and kept along the Coaſt, the better to take our Obſervation of the Shore, and ſo came back to land at the River's Mouth.</p>
                  <p>This was on the Seventh of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> 1683. The firſt thing we then took care to do, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn our humble thanks to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, for our good Succeſs, and for that he had carried us in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the end of our Voyage, after more than Eight Hundred Leagues, ſailing and rowing with ſo ſmall a handful of Men, and ſo little Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition; and that through ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny barbarous Nations, which we had not only diſcover'd, but in ſome meaſure made ſubject to us. We Sung the <hi>Te Deam;</hi> after which, taking our Canoos, and our Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page upon Sledges, we went and planted our Huts a little above the Shore, to be out of the reach of the Sea, which wholly overflows it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſix Hours Ebb, during which it's left quite dry.</p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:98822:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Having pitched here our New Camp, we ſaſtned a Croſs to the top of a large Tree, and ſet up the Arms of <hi>France:</hi> After which we raiſed three or four Huts more, and Entrenched our ſelves there. Then M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> took the Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to know where the Mouth of the <hi>Miſſiſſipi</hi> was. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had attempted to find it out, tho' in vain, had already given it the Name of <hi>Del Rio Aſcondido.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to M. <hi>de la Salle</hi>'s Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, it is between the Twenty ſecond and Twenty third Degree of Latitude; that it throws it ſelf into the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> with a large Channel which is Twenty Leagues wide, and very deep and Navigable.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> would be a little acquainted with its Shores, before he would leave them. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they are not fit to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, by reaſon of the frequent Inundations by the Spring-Tides,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98822:55"/>and the Barrenneſs of the Shore; there is nothing but Canes and Reeds, and Woods overthrown. But about a League and a half within the Country, it is the moſt pleaſant in the World, fine large Meadows, fair Woods full of Mulberry-trees, Nut-trees, and Cheſnut-trees. The Fields are covered with all ſorts of Fruit-Trees, as Orange, Lemmon, Pomegranate, and the ſides of the Hills with Vines, and the Fields bear <hi>Indian</hi> Corn twice a Year. We ſaw in all their ponds and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers vaſt quantities of Water-Fowl, Geeſe, Ducks, and Teal, Moor-hens, &amp;c. and in the Woods and Fields, Partridges, Pheaſants, Quails, and other kind of Fowl; of four Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Creatures all ſorts, eſpecially one large ſort of Oxen, which they call <hi>Cibola</hi>'s; theſe are much larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than any hath been mention'd, and are raiſed like a Cammel from the Chine to the middle of the Back; they feed among the Canes, and go together ſometimes no leſs in number than Fifteen Hundred.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98822:55"/>They Hunt them them after a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner. When they are in the midſt of theſe Canes, where there is no coming at them, the Savages get round about them, and ſet fire to 'em in ſeveral places, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when the Wind is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing high, which makes at firſt a mighty ſmoke, which turns all of a ſudden into a Flame, and this ſtrikes ſo great a terrour into the Herd, that they all diſperſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Savages, who lie in wait upon Trees, ſhoot ſome with Arrows, ſome with Bullets, and make an incredible Slaughter among them. By good Fortune, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages <hi>Tangibao, Quinipiſſas,</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> had been a Hunting when we were there (for they always join when they Hunt them) and they left us three fine large ones, which we ſeiz'd, and having dreſt them, they feaſted us all for three Days, and we had ſome left the day we went away from thence.</p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:98822:56"/>
                  <p>M. <hi>de la Salle,</hi> having a mind to go and give an Account of his Diſcoveries to Count <hi>Frontenac,</hi> and to confirm the Nations he had gone through in the good eſteem of us, reſolved to go up the ſame River back again to the <hi>IIlinois,</hi> and thence for the Lakes, in order to get to <hi>Quebeck,</hi> and from thence ſet Sail for <hi>France,</hi> and give the Court a true account of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
                  <p>The Eleventh of <hi>April</hi> of the ſame Year 1683, we got in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noo on the ſaid River; we were about Sixty of us. As this River divides it ſelf into three Channels, about Fifty Leagues from the Sea, we came the firſt day to the place where they met together, and in Six days after that, to the Point where it divides it ſelf: There our Victuals failing, it was highly neceſſary to look about us. The firſt Relief we met with, were ſome Crocodils; we kill'd two of 'em
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98822:56"/>in a little while, that were pretty large: The fleſh of them is good, white, firm, and very well taſted. It is as firm as Tunny, and near in taſte to Salmon, and we feaſted on it for ſome days. The Stream of our River began now to grow ſtronger againſt us, ſo that we were forced to get on Shore, and uſe our Sledges, as far as <hi>Quini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſſa</hi>'s. As this People had given us a ſcurvey welcome as we came down, we were forced to conſult how we ſhould do to make them a little more tractable, wherefore we ſent two <hi>Abenaguis,</hi> and two <hi>Loups</hi> towards them. They met with four Women only, which they brought to us that Night. This Prize pleaſed us very well, hoping that by their means, we ſhould beſt compaſs our Deſigns. We uſed thoſe Women with all the Civility and Prudence imaginable; and being come near to their Village, the next morning we ſent one of them home with ſome ſmall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, to ſhew that we did not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98822:57"/>come in an Hoſtile manner, only wanted their Friendſhip, and what was chiefly neceſſary, ſome Recruits of our Proviſions. She ſhewed them all the little Gewgaws we had given her, and related to them what good Entertainment ſhe had received from us, and what Deſigns we came upon. Immediately they ſent four of the Chief of their Nation to us, who brought along with them ſome Proviſions, and invited us to come and be merry with them. We then reſtored the Three Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men into their Hands, and we came nearer to them, but ſtill ſtanding upon our Guard. When we were come into their Village, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented us ſome of their Fruits, and ſome Water-Fowl pretty well dreſt. After this Refreſhment, we retired about a Hundred Paces from them, and lodged in our Huts that Night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Village and the River. By break of Day theſe treacherous Rogues ſurrounded, and attacked us: But they miſt of their aim; for we had ſet Sentinels, all that Night,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98822:57"/>and with their firſt Approach, we were prepared to receive them. We killed five or ſix the very firſt blow, upon which the reſt fled; and we purſued them a little way, and having killed three or four more, we thought that was enough, and we took their Scalps with us to ſerve for a Trophy.</p>
                  <p>From thence we went forward to the <hi>Naches;</hi> we had hid ſome <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Corn there, as we went down, and we found it again in very good condition. The Prince came ſtraightway to receive us; M. <hi>de la Salle,</hi> after the firſt Compliments paſs'd, preſented him with the Scalps of the <hi>Quinipiſſa</hi>'s we had brought with us, who were his greateſt Enemies. Which made it the more grateful, and ſerved to ſhew him that we were not Men to be fool'd with.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing he did, was to give order for ſomething to be fetch'd to refreſh us; which we
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98822:58"/>freely accepted of. All this while we obſerved that we ſaw no Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Village, which made us ſuſpect ſome Roguery. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we kept eating and drinking, and never ſeem'd to take any notice of any thing, but we kept our Arms all the while. A little while after we ſpied a great number of Men in Arms drawing towards us, and we in an inſtant put our ſelves in a poſture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. But the Prince bid us fear nothing, and aſſured us that we never needed to entertain any ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of them; he went up to 'em and commanded them to halt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, he told us, that it was a Party of his Men who had been againſt the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> but that they for their own part were reſolved ever to maintain a firm Friendſhip with us. His words he confirmed by ſome Preſents that followed, as alſo ſome Proviſions, which we heartily and thankfully received, leaving them, by way of return, ſome of our Canoos, which indeed
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98822:58"/>were but cumberſome to us; and that we came off ſafe and ſound, but we attributed our ſafety to our care and watchfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>After this, we continued our Courſe toward the <hi>Tacuca</hi>'s, and the <hi>Akancéa</hi>'s, who received us very handſomly at our Landing.</p>
                  <p>Thus, paſſing through ſo many different Nations, we made try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the faithfulneſs of ſome, and the treachery of others; and by a due mixture of mildneſs and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and a conſtant care, we did not only fruſtrate their Deſigns, and avoid their Ambuſh, but we brought them to Terms, and made them ſubmit to us.</p>
                  <p>On the Twelfth of <hi>May,</hi> 1683, we left the <hi>Akancéa</hi>'s, and puſhed forward to the Mouth of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the <hi>Illinois;</hi> after which we went on along the Shore, quite up to the Fort <hi>Preudhomme,</hi> where M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> fell dangerouſly ill. Father <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſtaid with him, with a good many of his Men; and I was commanded to go with Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Men to <hi>Miſſilamachinac,</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:98822:59"/>to look after his Affairs. I left him there the Fifteenth of <hi>May.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I went the firſt Day to lie at <hi>Ouabaches;</hi> where I was made very welcome.</p>
                  <p>Twenty Leagues further, I met with ſome <hi>Iroquois.</hi> Theſe Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, who are the moſt barbarous of all others, are ſneakingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive when their Party is the weakeſt, but moſt unmerciful when they have an advantage. There was but Five of them that met us; and they told us we ſhould not go far e're we ſhould meet a Company of above Four Hundred Men well Armed. This Advice made us take care to ſtand upon our Guard, for truly it is not very ſafe to fall into the Hands of theſe Barbarous People when they march in a Body. We had not gone a quarter of a League, but we ſpied a little Army, which we took at firſt to be <hi>Iroquois,</hi> but they were <hi>Tavaroa</hi>'s who had joined themſelves with ſome <hi>Illinois.</hi> They ſeeing our Fire-Arms, took us for <hi>Iroquois,</hi> and were going to ſurround us, with a Deſign to burn us, for that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98822:59"/>is the uſual way of dealing with thoſe barbarous Fellows, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they get any of them; ſo great is the abhorrence which all Nations have againſt them. But the <hi>Illinois</hi> having diſcover'd who we were, they unbent their Bows, and gave us part of their Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. We purſued our Road to the River <hi>Chicacou,</hi> and after Twenty Days Journey, we at length arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Miſſilimachinac,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>July;</hi> where we ſtaid for M. <hi>de la Salle,</hi> who came and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us in <hi>September</hi> the ſame Year. He ſtayed there but three Days, to give ſome neceſſary Orders. He gave me the command of Fort St. <hi>Louis,</hi> with orders to ſee it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and a full power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Lands adjacent, and left all his Men under me, except ſix <hi>French</hi> Men he took with him to <hi>Quebeck.</hi> We went away the ſame Day, he for <hi>Canada,</hi> I for the <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I went directly to <hi>Miamis,</hi> at the head of Forty Men, <hi>French</hi> and Savages. I came to it on the 6th
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98822:60"/>of <hi>January,</hi> 1684, and viſited the Fort, which was in a very good condition. There I left Ten of my Men well Armed, and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Journey, I got, by the end of the Month, to Fort St. <hi>Louis.</hi> I ſet Men at work about it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and in leſs than two Months time I compleated it. Preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, I invited all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations to come to it.</p>
                  <p>There needed no great pains or Art to get them thither. The beauty of the Country, the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Land, the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a fine Navigable River; the nearneſs of about a Hundred diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Nations, and of thoſe little Lakes, or rather little Seas, which make it a fit Seat of Commerce for all <hi>North America;</hi> and reach from the River St. <hi>Laurent</hi> to the Gulf of <hi>Mexico.</hi> In ſhort, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious Scituation of this Fort, which was deſign'd as a Bulwark for all the Nations that ſhould come to ſettle there, againſt Nations, was a ſufficient Invitation and Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98822:60"/>to them to come and dwell there. So that in a little time, there was above Five Hundred Huts made up, and in leſs than two Months, there was a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful great concourſe of People of all Nations. By this it is eaſie to be ſeen, with how little difficulty the Savages might be tamed, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, by planting here and there ſome Colonies of <hi>Europeans.</hi> For how few ſoever they be, they are, as it were a oiment of Concord and civil Society amongſt the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> being arriv'd at <hi>Quebec,</hi> had the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction not to meet with M. <hi>la Comte de Frontenac;</hi> for he had been re-manded to <hi>France</hi> by an Order from Court, and was gone thither. After his Arrival, he did not fail to acquaint all the City with the Diſcoveries he had made, and with the News of ſo many Nations yielding themſelves ſubject to the King's Power. The <hi>Te De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> was ſung, as an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this happy Addition of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98822:61"/>glory and Honour to the Crown. The earneſt deſire which M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> had, to go to give the King and his Miniſters an Account of the ſucceſs of his Travels, made him haſten his Departure. He went from <hi>Canada</hi> in the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> 1684. But before he ſet Sail, he ſent the Chevalier <hi>de Bogia</hi> to me, as a Perſon that had been highly recommended to him. He came to me to St. <hi>Louis</hi>'s Fort. I received him as well as I could, and gave him the beſt Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that my Condition would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me.</p>
                  <p>On the Twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> in the ſame Year; having received Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> being jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of our new Eſtabliſhment, were coming againſt us with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Forces; I ſent an Expreſs to M. <hi>de la Durontai,</hi> Governour of the Fort <hi>Miſſilimachinac,</hi> for ſome aſſiſtance. In the mean while I raiſed new Fortifications, and by means of good Ditches, Rampires, and other Works, I put the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage into a good poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98822:61"/>They came on the 28th of <hi>March,</hi> and lay before us, to the number of Five Hundred; we beat them back bravely in their very firſt Attacks; at laſt, after Six Weeks, we raiſed the Siege, and forced them to retire with the loſs of Fourſcore of theirs, and not of one of ours. They took a few Slaves in the Neighbourhood, that they might have ſomething to Brag of, and might not be thought to come back empty; but as they were juſt a going to flea their Scalps, the poor Wretches were happily ſo cunning as to get away, and came to us in our Fort.</p>
                  <p>About the 15th of <hi>April,</hi> M. <hi>de la Durontai,</hi> and Father <hi>de Loy</hi> a Jeſuit, with Sixty <hi>French</hi> came to aſſiſt me, but it was needleſs then. In the mean, while M. <hi>de la Barre</hi> was come to <hi>Quebeck,</hi> to ſucceed the Count <hi>de Frontenac.</hi> This Change was a dreadful blow to New <hi>France</hi> in general, which look'd upon Count <hi>de Frontenac</hi> as their Patron. But it proved no leſs ſevere, in reſpect to my own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98822:62"/>For no ſooner was this new Governour come over, who was a Friend and Relation of the Chevalier <hi>de Bogia,</hi> but he gave him the command of St. <hi>Louis</hi>'s Fort; the riſe and perfection of which were all owing to me. He directed his Orders to M. <hi>de la Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontai,</hi> to deliver to me; who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me with the new Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's Orders, to give up my Command of the place, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt the Chevalier therewith. I could do no other but obey the Orders. I left ſome conſiderable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the Fort, whereof I made an Inventory, which the Chevalier was ſo kind as to ſet his Hand to; and I left the place the ſame day, taking with me what was of moſt moment and uſe. I firſt took the Road of <hi>Montreal,</hi> and thence went to <hi>Quebeck,</hi> where I arriv'd in the beginning of <hi>July.</hi> I could do no leſs than go and wait on the Governour, and give him a faithful Account of the Condition and Importance of the place, which I had left by his Order, and of the ſtate of the Country in general. He
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98822:62"/>he heard me very courteouſly, and very civilly offer'd me any other Poſt I ſhould deſire in <hi>America.</hi> I thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for his kind Offers, and told him, I was not willing to take any Employment until M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> came back; and ſo we parted.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as I arriv'd, I did not fail to write to <hi>M. de la Salle,</hi> and give him an Account how I was ſerved, and how I thought my ſelf wronged, by being thus put out of the Command he had given me. Adding, that I really thought there might be ſome Danger of the Peoples ſitting uneaſie under a new Governour, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their new Habitations, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſome Diſorder. I writ beſides to M. <hi>de la Foreſt,</hi> a Friend of mine, to ſupport my Intereſts with our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Protector. Theſe Letters had all the good effect I could wiſh or hope for. I received an Anſwer to my Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs by M. <hi>de la Foreſt</hi> himſelf, who came back to <hi>Quebeck</hi> in the latter end of <hi>July</hi> 1684. I had the ſatisfaction to learn from him what a gracious reception M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> had met with at Court, and what conſiderable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98822:63"/>the King had granted him to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Colonies in the New-found-lands; and withal that he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd for the Gulf of <hi>Mexico;</hi> but what compleated my joy was, that I triumphed over mine Enemies, by my reſtitution to St. <hi>Louis</hi>'s Fort, in the Quality of Governour, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; for which this Gentleman brought me the Letters which M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> had obtain'd from the King in my favour.</p>
                  <p>I equipp'd my ſelf ſtraightway with Arms and all Materials neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as well for the Fortification of the place, as for the raiſing of my Company. And after we had ſpent ſome days together at <hi>Quebeck</hi> M. <hi>de la Foreſt</hi> and I, went away toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Firſt of <hi>Novebmer,</hi> he for <hi>Frontenac,</hi> of which place he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Governour, and I for the <hi>Illinois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ice putting a ſtop to our Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age on the River of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> we were forced to ſtay and Winter at <hi>Montreal,</hi> until the next Spring, in 1685.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> we got up the River again as far as the Fort
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98822:63"/>
                     <hi>Frontenac,</hi> where I took my leave of M. <hi>la Foreſt.</hi> I went in a Canoos on the firſt Lake to <hi>Magara,</hi> where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had ſhot the fall of the River, I got to <hi>Miſſilimachinac,</hi> and then to <hi>Miamis,</hi> and being come to the Mouth of the River of the <hi>Illinois,</hi> I went to Fort St. <hi>Louis,</hi> about <hi>June</hi> 15 in the ſame Year.</p>
                  <p>The Chevalier <hi>de Bogia,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately entertain'd me with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible marks of Joy, Friendſhip, and Reſpect; and I endeavour'd to make a ſuitable return to his Kindneſs; but at laſt, after having inform'd him of M. <hi>de la Salle</hi>'s Embarking, and of all other News then ſtirring; I found my ſelf oblig'd to ſhew him the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents, to be Commander in Chief, and Governour of Fort St. <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,</hi> with which the King thought ſit to honour me. He receiv'd this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with a great deal of ſubmiſſion, and put me again in poſſeſſion of the place, with all the Effects with which I had entruſted him, aſſuring me, at the ſame time, that nevertheleſs he ſhould ſtill be ready to do me ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice upon all occaſions, and always
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98822:64"/>to perform the Office of a faithful Friend. We ſpent the reſt of the day together in amicable Converſation, and the next Morning he departed a third time for the Town of <hi>Quebeck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while the <hi>Miamis</hi> and the <hi>Illinois,</hi> neighbouring Nations and our Allies, being at variance about, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain trivial pretenſions; I endeavour'd to reconcile them; having, receiv'd from both Parties Hoſtages and Pledges of their Fidelity. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> being much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd that I had heard no News of M. <hi>de la Salle,</hi> I paſs'd over to <hi>Miſſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machinac,</hi> to make ſome Enquiry after him. There I was inform'd that the Marqueſs <hi>d'Enonville</hi> ſucceeded M. <hi>de la Barre,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">M. <hi>D'</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonville <hi>nominated in the place of</hi> M. de la Barre.</note> in quality of Governour of <hi>New France;</hi> and I had alſo the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to receive a Letter from him; in which he was pleas'd to expreſs his deſire of entring into a Conference with me, about the Deſign he had to make War with the <hi>Iroquois;</hi> at the ſame time he gave me to underſtand, that M. <hi>de la Salle,</hi> having been for a long time at Sea, had, without doubt, already enter'd the Gulf with four
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98822:64"/>tight Ships, given him by the King, and that apparently he muſt needs have arriv'd at the Mouth of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Miſſiſſipi,</hi> or in ſome other Port.</p>
                  <p>This Letter ſerv'd only to increaſe the Earneſt deſire I had to meet him, inſomuch that I immediately took care to provide what Supplies I could for him; fitted out Twenty <hi>Canadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and returning to the <hi>Illinois,</hi> with my new Recruits; I arriv'd within a Month, at St. <hi>Louis</hi>'s Fort: Where, after having given neceſſary Orders, I left the Command of the Place to the <hi>Sieur de Bellefontaine;</hi> and ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with Forty Men for the Gulf of <hi>Mexico.</hi> Thus we paſs'd down our River into the great one of <hi>Miſſiſſipi,</hi> follow'd its Courſe to the Sea, and ſpent about two Months in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Voyage.</p>
                  <p>Upon our Arrival on the Sea ſhore, not meeting with what I ſought for, nor any Perſon who could give me any Information about the matter, I ſent out two Boats, <hi>viz.</hi> one to the <hi>Eaſty</hi> and the other to the <hi>South-weſt,</hi> to endeavour to make ſome Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: They row'd up and down about
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98822:65"/>Twenty Leagues from one ſide to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, along the Coaſt, and having deſcry'd nothing, were oblig'd to ſtand in for ſome Port for want of Freſh Water, and return'd to join our Fleet, after a Courſe of two days; without being able to get any notice of what I expected. All that I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them by way of Conſolation, was only a Porpoiſe, and ſome very ſine Shells of Mother of Pearl, which they took on a Rock.</p>
                  <p>Therefore perceiving that it would be to no purpoſe to wait there any longer, I advis'd with the moſt prudent Men of our Company, about the Courſe we ought to ſteer at our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. I was inclin'd to follow the Coaſt as far as <hi>Menada,</hi> hoping by that means, continually to diſcover ſome new Country, or to take ſome good Prize: But the moſt part were of the contrary Opinion; affirming it was ſafer to keep a known Road, rather than to take one that was not ſo, and which otherwiſe could not but be of very difficult paſſage; as well by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the High Lands along the Coaſts, as for the great number of Rivers that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98822:65"/>unload themſelves into the Sea; ſo that we were oblig'd to take a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to return the ſame way that we came.</p>
                  <p>Before our Departure, having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that the Tree on which M. <hi>de la Salle</hi> had caus'd a Croſs, with the Kings Arms to be ſet up, was ready to be thrown down by the boiſtrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Winds and Waves, we got up a little higher, where having E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a large Pillar, we fixt a Croſs upon it, and underneath the Arms of <hi>France.</hi> We lodg'd that Night in the ſame place, but the next Morning being <hi>Eaſter</hi> Monday, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1685. we ſet forward on our Journey, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling by Land along the Banks of the River <hi>Miſſiſſipi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the Sixth day, being arriv'd in the Country of the <hi>Qinipiſſa's;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Quini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſſa<hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with the</hi> French.</note> their Commander in Chief came to meet us, and having offer'd us the <hi>Calumet,</hi> begg'd pardon for their ill uſage of us, during our laſt Voyage; entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us that we would vouchſafe to admit 'em into the number of our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. However we anſwer'd their ſubmiſſive Addreſſes very magiſterial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and having refreſh'd our ſelves a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98822:66"/>little among 'em, we purſu'd our Journey. Four Leagues above, we diſcover'd in the Country a certain Nation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ouma</hi>'s a Savage People.</note> that had eſcap'd from us at our firſt Deſcent, I mean that of the <hi>Ouma</hi>'s, who are the moſt valiant of all the Savages; altho' it be true indeed, that as ſoon as they ſaw us and our Arms, they were ſtruck with a kind of Aſtoniſhment, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a panick Fear, that quite curb'd their fierceneſs, and oblig'd them to promiſe an entire Obedience to our Injunctions: They offer'd us ſome new Refreſhments, and to ſerve us to the utmoſt of their power.<note place="margin">A ſtrange Beaſt.</note> In thoſe Territories we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd an extraordinary rare Animal, that partakes of the nature of a Wolf and a Lion; as having the Head and ſize of a large Wolf, but the Tail and Claws of a Lion: He devours all ſorts of Beaſts, yet never ſets upon Men: He ſometimes carries his Prey on his Back, eats part of it, and hides the reſt under the Leaves of Trees; but the other Animals have ſo great an Antipathy againſt this Beaſt, which is call'd <hi>Michibichi,</hi> that they never touch what he leaves.</p>

                        <hi>Akanceas</hi> a Nation.</note>After the <hi>Oumas</hi> we met with the <hi>Akanceas.</hi> Indeed all theſe Countries are ſo pleaſant, and ſo extremely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd with the Productions of Nature, that we could not ſufficiently admire 'em: The Trees in the Woods, which are of an extraordinary heigth, ſeem'd to be artificially planted in Rows: The Soil brings forth good Grain, with great variety of Fruit-Trees, and the Fields are every where ſtor'd with all ſorts of Game, both for Hawk and Hound; but there is alſo abundance of huge wild Cats, which devour every thing that they can find. Our <hi>French</hi> Men charm'd with the Beauty of this Climate, deſir'd leave of me to ſettle there; and foraſmuch as our Intention was to civilize the Savages, and to render 'em ſociable by our Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I readily conſented to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Whereupon I made the Draught of a Houſe for my ſelf among the <hi>Akan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas,</hi> and left Ten <hi>French</hi> Men of my Retinue with Four Savages, to carry on the Building of it; granting 'em a Licenſe to lodge there themſelves, and to cultivate as much Land as they could grub up, and clear of Trees: Inſomuch, that this ſmall Colony was in Proceſs
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98822:67"/>of Time ſo extremely increas'd and improv'd, that it ſerves as a Place of Rendez-vous to the <hi>French,</hi> who travel into theſe Parts.</p>
                  <p>From thence I continu'd my Courſe along the River of the <hi>Iſlinois,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Three Days Journey arriv'd at St. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Fort, on the Feſtival of St. <hi>John,</hi> being leſs tir'd with the Fatigues of my Travels, than perplexed about the Uncertainty of M. <hi>De La Salle</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny. Foraſmuch as I had not as yet paid my Reſpects to our new Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; after having paſs'd ſome Days in refreſhing my ſelf, I left the <hi>Iſlinois</hi> in the end of the Month of <hi>June,</hi> and arriv'd at <hi>Montreal, July</hi> 15.

                  <p>Having receiv'd this Commiſſion, I ſoon took leave of Monſieur <hi>D' Enon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> and arriv'd in the Country of the <hi>Iſlinois, Septemb.</hi> 4. from whence I ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diſpatch'd divers Couriers from all Parts, to give notice to the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations of our Deſign, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort

                  <p>This Speech was follow'd with the general Acclamations of all the People; whereupon I immediately put my ſelf at the Head of 'em, and began to march to the Canal that joyns the two Lakes of the <hi>Suvrons</hi> and the <hi>Iſlinois.</hi> In that Place ſtands a Fort that bears the Name of St. <hi>Joſeph,</hi>

                  <p>The management of Affairs being thus diſpos'd of, <hi>M. de la Durontay</hi> march'd along the Coaſts of <hi>Miſſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machinac,</hi> and met with a conſiderable Party of the Enemies, compos'd of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 500 Men, as well <hi>Engliſh</hi> as <hi>Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quois,</hi> (here it may be obſerv'd by the way, that thoſe two Nations main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſtrict mutual Amity,<note place="margin">The <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> and <hi>Iroquois</hi> are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make War with the <hi>French.</hi>
                     </note> when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd together againſt the <hi>French</hi>) and attack'd 'em ſo vigorouſly, that above half of 'em were kill'd on the ſpot; ſome Priſoners were taken; and the reſt were put to flight.</p>
                  <p>On our ſide, at the diſtance of 20 Leagues from <hi>Niagara,</hi> we found Means to meet with a numerous Party of <hi>Engliſh, Iroquois,</hi> and <hi>Ouabaches,</hi> who under the Conduct of Major <hi>Gregory,</hi> were conveying a great quantity of Brandy, Proviſions, Ammunition, and Merchandizes, to the Inhabitants of the <hi>Iroquois.</hi> We fell upon 'em; and after having kill'd the greateſt part of the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> and of the other Savages, we ſeiz'd on their Baggages and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes, took a great number of Slaves, and carry'd away above 25 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men Priſoners. After this ſmall Victory we continued our March
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98822:69"/>to <hi>Niagara,</hi> where we compleated the Building of the Fort in ſight of the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> and even at the very Foot of their Habitations.</p>
                  <p>The proſperous Succeſs of our Arms in the beginning oblig'd us to ſend a Meſſenger to the Governour, to give him an Account of every thing that had paſs'd, and <hi>M. de la Foret,</hi> who was very deſirous to accept of this Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſet forward with all poſſible ſpeed. <hi>M. D'Enonville</hi> receiv'd the Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a great deal of Satisfaction; caus'd it to be communicated to the whole Continent of <hi>Canada;</hi> and ſent us freſh Supplies of <hi>Hurons, Plononteaus</hi> and <hi>Ouatoua's;</hi> who came to meet us at the Riſe of the Cataract, with a Bark very well mann'd.</p>
                  <p>Thus being re-enforc'd with theſe new Recruits, I march'd further into the Territories of the Enemies; but we entertain'd in our Camp a certain <hi>Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quois,</hi> who feigning to be diſguſted at the Proceedings of his own Nation, ſeem'd to be extremely well affected to ours; nevertheleſs this treacherous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negado took an Opportunity to abandon us to return w the <hi>Enemies Army,</hi> and gave 'em notice of our March, as alſo of the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98822:69"/>Marks of bur Savages, ſo as they might be certainly diſcover'd. Thus as we were continually advancing forward, we arriv'd on the other ſide of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs, at the diſtance of Three Leagues from the Camp of the <hi>Iroquois;</hi> where ſome of 'em lay in Ambuſh, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Approach, and kill'd Seven of our Men, among whom was my Sub-Lieutenant: However we ſoon rally'd, repuls'd 'em vigorouſly, and after having cut off above Thirty of their Party, purſu'd 'em to the Woods; but not being able to come up with 'em, and not judging it ſafe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance any further, leſt we ſhould fall into another Ambuſcade, we contented our ſelves to plunder their Villages, where we put to the Edge of the Sword every one whom we met in our way.</p>
                  <p>We encamped for ſome Days in that Place, and the Army under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>M. de Lude</hi> and <hi>M. de la Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontay</hi> came to joyn ours. The next day after their Arrival we did not ſtay a moment, e're we took a Reſolution to force the Enemies Camp; who being inform'd of bur Deſign, by their Spies, did not think fit to wait for our
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98822:70"/>Approach, but decamp'd with great Precipitation. We found in their Camp ſome Remainders of <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, and other Proviſions, which we made uſe of to our Advantage, and we ſpent the Night in their Tents, or rather Huts; the Seaſon being already very far advanc'd. The next Morning we ſent back all our Allies to their ſeveral Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, with Orders to meet together again upon the firſt Summons; while the <hi>Sieurs de la Lude</hi> and <hi>de la Durontay</hi> repair'd to their Reſpective Stations.</p>
                  <p>As I was marching to mine, I met with certain <hi>Hurons,</hi> who gave me to underſtand, that I was ready to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with the whole Army of the <hi>Iroquois.</hi> There was no longer any Means to have recourſe to <hi>M. de Lude,</hi> and <hi>de la Durontay,</hi> who were already embark'd in Canoos on the Lakes; inſomuch, that I was oblig'd to cauſe my ſmall Band of Men to halt, and inſtantly to diſpatch a Courier to <hi>Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara</hi> to demand ſpeedy Succours of the Commander of the new Fort. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd accidentally, that <hi>M. de la Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romè,</hi> the Governour of it, ſuppoſing us to be engag'd with the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> was leading up Fifty Fuſileers to our Relief,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98822:70"/>and in the mean while the Meſſenger whom I ſent, having met with him, inform'd him of our preſent Diſtreſs, which caus'd him to haſten his March: His Arrival inſpir'd us with new Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſo that the Enemies appearing, we ſet our ſmall Army in Battel-array; yet when we had advanced towards 'em within Musket-ſhot, they had not the Courage to ſtay for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, but ſuddenly turn'd their Backs upon us: Whereupon we purſued 'em for ſome time, till about 100 of them periſh'd on the ſpot, and the reſt found Means to eſcape into the Woods. Then I immediately caus'd a Retreat to be founded; and having convoy'd <hi>M. de Valromè</hi> on part of his way, I judg'd it expedient to take up our Winter-Quarters at <hi>Miſſilimachinac,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide there till the next Campaign, in caſe the War ſhould continue.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quois</hi> forc'd to ſubmit.</note>The Scene of Affairs began now to be chang'd; for the <hi>Iroquois</hi> reſign'd to us their Habitations that were near <hi>Niaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi> made a Preſent of their beſt Skins to the Governour; and engag'd that for the future they ſhould not diſturb the Tranquillity of the Nations that were under our Protection, and who were
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98822:71"/>our Allies. A Treaty of Peace being thus concluded, I ſet forward in my Journey to the Country of the <hi>Iſlinois</hi> in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> 1687. and ſhould have been very well ſatisfied with the Succeſs of the Campaign, if I had not been continually troubled, by reaſon of <hi>M.

                  <p>As ſoon as I enter'd my Houſe, I was extremely ſurpriz'd, there to meet with <hi>M. Cavelier, M.

Upon this Addreſs, he appear'd to be altogether put to a ſtand; ſo that a ſad Look up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, a deep Sigh, and a certain Effort, which he ſeem'd to make within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, were taken by me as ſo many ill Omens; I earneſtly entreated him to conceal nothing from me, and after he had recover'd himſelf a little, he told me very poſitively, <q>That <hi>M. de la Salle</hi> his Brother was in perfect Health; but that the ill Succeſs of his Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had ſo far pull'd down his Spirits, that he had ſcarce Courage to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his Courſe; that in returning by ſmall Voyages, he took delight in trading with the different Nations, whom he met with; and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98822:72"/>charg'd him to go before, to give me notice of his Arrival, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd ſtill to reſide among the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> and <hi>Akanceas</hi> for ſome time, to purchaſe certain Merchandizes of both thoſe Nations.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Aſſurance, with which he ſpoke to me, joyn'd with a Shew of downright Integrity, which was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to him, beſides the Deference due to a Perſon of his Character; for he was a Prieſt, would not ſuffer me in the leaſt to call in Queſtion the vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his Relation, and ſerv'd a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to encourage me againſt my ſad Preſages. Therefore I entreated him to give me an Account of his Voyage, and to let me know when they re-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd, and at what time they landed. Since then I gave him a great deal of Scope, to deliver his Mind ingenuouſly, and without Conſtraint, he began to relate the particular Circumſtances with ſo much the more Freedom.</p>
                  <p>He told me at firſt, <q>That the whole Court of <hi>France,</hi> being charm'd with the great Diſcoveries made by <hi>M. de la Salle,</hi> the King made no ſcruple at all to grant him the Supplies he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd; not to mention the Titles of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98822:72"/>Honour, that procur'd him greater Authority in his new Plantations: That they ſet out from <hi>France, July</hi> 24. <hi>A. D.</hi> 1684. with four Veſſels, very well provided of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and above 200 Men, as well Soldiers as Artificers of all ſorts of Trades, and that nevertheleſs by a Complication of Misfortunes, their whole Fleet was reduc'd to a few Boats, and that great number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to Seven or Eight <hi>French</hi> Men, who ſerv'd as a Convoy to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther during his Return.</q>

                  <p>Foraſmuch as theſe Remarkable Croſſes afforded Matter of Wonder, I could not chooſe but be very deſirous to be inform'd of all the Particulars of their Adventures: Whereupon <hi>M. Cavelier</hi> reſuming his former Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from the beginning of their Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, told me, <q>That after a Calm which continued for ſome Days, in the Latitude of St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> they were ſuddenly ſurpriz'd with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Storm; inſomuch, that one of their Ships, laden with Merchandizes, to the value of above Thirty Thouſand Livres, was hurry'd away with a furious Blaſt of Wind, and afterwards
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98822:73"/>taken by certain <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Piroques.</note> Rovers: That the reſt of the Fleet caſt Anchor before the ſame Iſland, where they were ſoon refitted, and ſupply'd with freſh Proviſions, which with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes there bought, ſerv'd for the Cargo of theſe Veſſels, but that the greateſt part of the Mariners, by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſomewhat too licentiouſly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted very dangerous Diſeaſes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That they cruis'd about from thence towards the Iſlands of <hi>Caimant,</hi> and took in freſh Water on that of <hi>Cuba;</hi> where, having found many Tuns of Canary, good Brandy, Sugar, and <hi>Indian</hi> Corn left unguarded, they ſeiz'd on the whole Cargo, and got ſuch Repriſals as were ſufficient to make 'em amends for the loſs of every thing that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had taken from them before: That afterwards being ſupply'd with all manner of Proviſions, they ſet Sail again; and that having always had a favourable Gale of Wind, they would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Gulph of <hi>Mexico;</hi> but that perceiving the Currents to be very rapid, and the Shelves to be nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, they were oblig'd to ſtand off from the Shoar, which hinder'd <hi>M.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98822:73"/>de la Salle</hi> from lighting on the exact degree of Latitude, for the Mouth of the River <hi>Miſſiſſipi;</hi> inſomuch, that to avoid the expoſing of the Men to greater Dangers, he order'd 'em to land at the Bay of <hi>Spiritu Santo,</hi> 50 Leagues below the River they ſought for: But two Days after, hoping to diſcover it, they got on Board their Ships again, and always taking care to ſteer into the Main, to ſhun the Rocks and Shelves, they at laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd a great deal higher in a Bay, afterwards known by the name of St. <hi>Lewis.</hi> This Bay is of a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Depth for a Harbour; but 'tis dangerous landing there, as well by reaſon of the Shelves of Sand that encompaſs it; as for the Rocks with which 'tis beſet on all ſides.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Indeed the miſſing of the Entrance of the River (continued he) would have been no great Detriment to us; for after having once arriv'd ſo near its Mouth, it would have been difficult to deſcry it, at leaſt by Land; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to convey our Ships thither; to form a kind of Harbour, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Miſtakes for the future; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to build a regular Port; but ill
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98822:74"/>Luck would have it, that after <hi>M. de Beaujeu,</hi> who commanded one of the three Veſſels, was come on Board our Ship; the two others were loſt, as well by the ill Management of the Pilot, as by the Careleſneſs of the Mariners; for the firſt ran upon a ſhelf of Sand in the Mouth of the Bay, from whence it was impoſſible to get her off, notwithſtanding our utmoſt Endeavours; altho' indeed we were ſo fortunate as to ſave the Men, and the beſt of our Effects. The other Ship was daſh'd in pieces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Rock, even in the very Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, with the loſs of the moſt part of the Mariners; but we had luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kily unloaded it of all our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Merchandizes: Beſides, that the greateſt part of our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Goods were ſet aſhoar by <hi>M. de Beaujeu,</hi> who after having been a Witneſs of our Misfortunes, ſet Sail to return for <hi>France.</hi>

                     <hi>M.

                  <p>
                     <q>At laſt after Fifteen Days ſearch he met with a ſpacious River, and follow'd the Courſe of it for Seven or Eight Leagues to the Place, where it rolls into the Sea, and perceiv'd it to be really that which he had ſo long ſought for, and the Mouth of which he was not able to diſcover: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took an Obſervation of its La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude again, that he might not miſs it, in caſe he ſhould have occaſion to paſs thro' the Gulph at any other time.

As for the four Deſerters, it is not known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were excited by the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of thoſe Countries, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſettle themſelves among ſome of the Neighbouring Nations; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98822:84"/>being entic'd by the alluring Baits of the Savageſſes, they return'd to the <hi>Cenis;</hi> or whether they retir'd to the <hi>Naſſonis.</hi> However, 'tis certain, that as ſoon as they had Horſes in their Poſſeſſion, they did not any longer imagine themſelves to be among the Savages; ſo that we were not able to retain 'em, neither could we have any Tidings of 'em ever ſince that end.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>As for my Brother's Indiſpoſition, it was undoubtedly the Effect of Grief occaſion'd by the Deſertion of ſome of his Attendants. He fell ſick, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 24. in the ſame Year 1685. After three Months travelling, and within 200 Leagues of St. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Bay. His Sickneſs was follow'd almoſt at the ſame time with that of <hi>De Moranget,</hi> our Nephew. However, during that Affliction, we had the good Luck to find among the Savages all the Help that could have been procur'd in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> except Phyſitians: For we had every thing that we could wiſh for, particularly Veal, Mutton, Pullets, Pigeons and Ring-doves; beſides, all ſorts of wholeſome Herbs, as well for Pottage, as for Ptiſans, Decoctions,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98822:85"/>and other Remedies neceſſary for ſick Perſons. Our two Surgeons were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo preſent, and were very ſerviceable to us upon this occaſion; nay, the very Savages themſelves, as well Men as Women, gave us Meat, Fowl, and other ſorts of Veniſon; inſomuch, that at laſt (thanks be to the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) by the Means of our diligent Care, both our Patients recover'd their Health, after a Months Indiſpoſition.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>As ſoon they had regain'd their Strength, my Brother being of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that he ought to improve his laſt Diſcoveries; and not being able to go any farther, without entring the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> from whence according to all probability, we ſhould never have come back; took a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to return to his new Colony. Therefore we ſet forward again in our Journey in the end of the Month of <hi>September,</hi> 1685. But we had this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that we were now in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to return on Horſeback, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we came on Foot; That which was moſt ſurprizing in our new Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture is that our Horſes without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhod, had ſo hard a Hoof, that they could go any where; and had ſo
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98822:85"/>tender a Mouth, that they gave way to the Curb, as if they had been train'd up to it: Every one of our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was reaſonably well mounted, and our ſupernumerary Horſes ſerv'd either for Change, or inſtead of Pack-Horſes, to carry our Proviſion, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noos, and other Equipage; which was no ſmall Conſolation to us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>However, ſince the moſt uſeful things ſometimes prove the moſt fatal, it happen'd either accidentally, or for want of Skill, that one of our Horſes occaſion'd the Loſs of a Savage belonging to our Retinue. For on the Banks of the River <hi>La Maligne,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile drags a Man into the Water, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours him.</note> on which my Brother run the hazard of being loſt, a Horſe prancing at the ſight of a huge Crocodile, threw his Rider into the Water. He had ſcarce fallen, when that ravenous Beaſt drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him away, and devour'd him in our ſight. We were extremely trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd at this ſad Spectacle; but in ſuch Voyages 'tis difficult to avoid the ſad Accidents, to which thoſe who undertake 'em are ſometimes liable. Therefore the ſafeſt way for a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller is to prepare for ſuch Diſaſters, by quieting his Conſcience, and by
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98822:86"/>putting himſelf under the Protection of Almighty God, who is our Guide, and conſtant Preſerve.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Foraſmuch as no Remedy could be found for this Misfortune, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd our Journey; and after Three Months march, we arriv'd at St. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wis</hi>'s Bay in the beginning of the Month of <hi>January,</hi> 1686. As ſoon as we came near our Colony, we perceiv'd that all the Fields thereabouts were clear'd of Trees, and well cultivated. We there met with a great number of Women, and Cottages, fill'd with new Families, each Family having its peculiar Store of Proviſions, with a Garden, and other Apartments. In a word, every thing ſeem'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a happy Improvement, and a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Increaſe. My Brother was receiv'd there as the Father of this little Common-wealth, and we took great Delight in obſerving theſe beginnings of the Incorporation of our <hi>French</hi> Men with the Savages, and the good Uſe that every one made of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of this new Plantation.</q>

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98822:86"/>Fort, as for the modelling of this new State, we ſojourn'd there about Three Months longer; after the expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which time, he determin'd to return to <hi>France</hi> to get new Supplies at that Court, and to procure ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits of Tradeſmen, Artificers and Labourers, as well in favour of this laſt Colony, as for all the others that are planted in divers parts of Northern <hi>America.</hi> After having taken leave of every one, he ſet out, accompany'd with 20 <hi>French</hi> Men for <hi>Canada,</hi> and travell'd by Land to the Country of the <hi>Iſlinois,</hi> in the end of the Month of <hi>March, A.

                     <q>Altho' this Road was the moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, yet it ſerv'd not only to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Courſe of the Rivers,<note place="margin">Many Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> of which we only ſaw the Mouths, in paſſing down the <hi>Miſſiſſipi;</hi> but alſo to give us a nearer View of all the People, who inhabit along the Banks; ſo that we might take frequent Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to contract new Alliances with 'em.

                     </q> 
                     <hi>Indeed we were then ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, as nto to meet with you there, (which was no ſmall trouble to us); but at preſent we have the Conſolation to ſee you in good Health.</hi>

                  <p>M. <hi>Cavelier</hi> having thus concluded his Relation, we renew'd our Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but I continu'd for ſome time ſpeechleſs, without being able to make any Application to him; for, to ſay the Truth, I did not well know my ſelf, nor in what condition I was at that time. On the one ſide, the loſs of our Fleet, and of the greateſt part of the <hi>French</hi> Mariners, was a very great Mortification to me; and on the other ſide, the Aſſurance that was given me of <hi>M. de la Salle</hi>'s Welfare, and of the Succeſs of ſo many ſine Diſcoveries, oblig'd me to turn my Sorrow into Joy. I was alſo extremely furpriz'd at the ſtrangeneſs of his Adventures; but at the ſame time, the Abſence of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for whom I had ſo particular a Reſpect, and whoſe Return I had ſo
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98822:92"/>long expected with the utmoſt Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; beſides, the Regret upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting, that I was not an Eye witneſs, and a Companion of his Travels, pierc'd my Heart with ſo ſenſible a Grief, that I was not by any means able to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount it. Neither could I any longer contain my ſelf, or forbear eaſing my Mind a little, by uttering theſe mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Expoſtulations. <q>Alaſs! (ſaid I to <hi>M. Cavelier</hi>) how could it ſo fall out, that <hi>M. de la Salle,</hi> my Patron, and my only Support, ſhould ſpend Two Years in returning to <hi>America,</hi> and that during that whole Term, I ſhould not be only depriv'd of the Pleaſure of ſeeing him, but alſo ſhould not find Means to hear any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tidings of him? Or how is it poſſible that I ſhould not be permitted to embrace him? I muſt freely declare to you, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Joy which your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence affords me, I find my ſelf ſeiz'd in beholding you, with a more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe Grief, ſince the more I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, I am ſo much the more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that I have not a ſight of him.

'tis not my Fault; for as ſoon as I could judge, that he had touch'd at any of the Coaſt of the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> I made a deſcent on thoſe Countries; I ſearch'd about all the Capes and Shoars of that Sea, as well on the ſide of <hi>Malcolina,</hi> as on that of <hi>Mexico;</hi> I viſited all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who inhabit thoſe Coaſts, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>

                     <q>'Tis true indeed, (ſaid he) and he would certainly have done it, if it had lain in his Power: But who of thoſe new Comers could find out the Roads that lay croſs the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſo many <hi>Barbarians</hi> or would be willing to make ſuch an Attempt at ſo great a diſtance? Or could he ſpare me, or either of his two Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews for that purpoſe? Beſides, the Hopes he had of ſeeing you ere long in Perſon, made him continually defer to inform you of his Arrival. It muſt be confeſs'd (ſaid I then) there is no Remedy for what is paſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which revives my Spirits is, to hear that he is in good Health, and whereabouts he is: It will not be long (by the help of God) are we ſhall go again to find him out.

For that very Reaſon he alſo ſent me to <hi>Quebec,</hi> and gave me a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Charge to wait upon you, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to borrow ſome Money, upon the Receipt of which I will give you an Acquittance, and my Brother will place it to Account.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this Diſcourſe he preſented me with a Letter, which was well ſeal'd with <hi>M. de la Salle</hi>'s Seal. As for the Writing, I did not examine it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Characters us'd by thoſe two Gentlemen, who wrote almoſt the ſame

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I read that Letter with extreme Delight; in which, the ſame Requeſt was contain'd, with Proteſtations of an entire Truſt, and of a moſt ſincere Friendſhip. The Joy with which I was tranſported, to hear Tidings of ſo intimate a Friend; the Candour of the Perſon who deliver'd the Letter to me; and the Devotion I had made of every thing that I poſſeſs'd, to the diſpoſal of a Perſon, to whom I thought my ſelf infinitely indebted; did not ſuffer me to take the matter into Conſideration. I immediately ask'd <hi>M. Cavelier</hi> how much Money he deſir'd? Whereupon he told me, that he believ'd his Brother had mention'd the Sum of 7000 Livers. <hi>'Tis true indeed</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>but if you have occaſion for more, you need only demand it of me, ſince all that I have is at your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> He thank'd me heartily, and told me, that in caſe he ſhould ſtand in need of ſomewhat more, he might procure it in <hi>France.</hi> Therefore I paid him the Sum of Money agreed upon, at that very Inſtant, and he inſiſted to give me his Receipt, according to the Order, which (as he ſaid) he had from his

I readily conſented, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he proteſted to me, that he determin'd to ſet out on his Journey the next day, I gave ſome Refreſhment to his Attendants, and recruited his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.

                  <p>
                     <q>Afterwards the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man and the <hi>German</hi> made themſelves Maſters of their Spoils, and offer'd 'em all to the diſcretion of the two <hi>M. Caveliers,</hi> who only took as much as was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98822:100"/>for their Journey; and having left 'em the reſt, came to me in the Country of the <hi>Akanceas.</hi> They were the Uncle and the Nephew, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with M. <hi>de la Marne,</hi> and M. <hi>Jouſtel,</hi> and a <hi>Chaouanou</hi> savage, and I had all that I have related from their own Mouth: I was alſo an Eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Lamentations and Tears; they reſted Two Days in your Houſe, and on the third following they ſet out for the <hi>Iſlinois.</hi> Thus, Sir, I have given you a particular Account of what you deſir'd, according to the beſt of my Knowledge.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I only convers'd (ſaid I then) with the Uncle and the Father <hi>Recolet,</hi> but as for the Nephew, M. <hi>Jouſtel</hi> and the <hi>Chaouanou,</hi> I had no ſight of 'em. As for M. <hi>de la Marne,</hi> I remember that M. <hi>Cavelier</hi> told me, that he was drown'd; nevertheleſs, I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my ſelf from my Surprize, when I reflect on the Conſtancy and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of Mind, with which he relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me the particular Circumſtances of his whole Voyage, and all his Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 'Tis a common Saying, that deep Sorrow is dumb, and I dare not call in queſtion the Sincerity of his;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98822:101"/>but I am certain, that he has made no Scruple to croſs the Proverb.</q> He had ſome occaſion to uſe Diſſimulation (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Couſture</hi>) <q>He was willing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to allay his Grief, by the telling of long Stories; and beſides, he had ſome By-ends, and ſome particular Reaſons for ſuch a Deportment at that time.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I very well comprehend your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (ſaid I) he was deſirous to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Money of me, and he was afraid, leſt I ſhould refuſe to lend him any, if he inform'd me of his Brother's Death. But alaſs! I was too much indebted to his Name and Family, to deny him any thing. Would to God I had nothing left in the World, and had not loſt my honoured Protector, my dear Patron, and my moſt faithful Friend! But alaſs! all our Lamentations are to no purpoſe; and ſince we cannot repair ſo great a Loſs, let us at leaſt arm our ſelves with Patience; let us alſo endeavour to bring to Perfection what he has ſo happily begun.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At that very inſtant I encourag'd my ſelf in my Reſolution to make another Voyage, with a Deſign not only to carry Relief to thoſe poor <hi>French</hi> Men,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98822:101"/>who were abandon'd on the Sea-ſhoar, but alſo to undertake ſome new Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, that might afford me ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation for the Loſs I had ſuſtain'd. To that purpoſe I made Preparations for a new Deſcent to the Seas, and to viſit all thoſe Nations that were late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover'd by <hi>M. de La Salle,</hi> and mention'd to me by his Brother.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while I receiv'd a Letter from the Marquis <hi>D'Enonville,</hi> our Governour; the Purport of which was to inform me, That we were engag'd in a War againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">War with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi>
                     </note> and by which he gave me free Liberty to make what Attempts I could upon 'em. This Letter, in Conjunction with what <hi>M. Cavelier</hi> had told me concerning thoſe Nations, who were ready to make War with 'em, animated me ſo much the more to haſten my Journey. Therefore I ſet out <hi>Decemb.</hi> 3. <hi>A. D.</hi> 1687. accompany'd with five <hi>French</hi> Men, four <hi>Chaouanous,</hi> and ſome other Savages, and left my Couſin <hi>De Liette,</hi> Commander of Fort St. <hi>Lewis.</hi> My firſt Journey ended in the Village of the <hi>Iſlinois,</hi> and I found 'em lately come back from an Expedition againſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98822:102"/>Neighbouring People, from whom they carry'd away 130 Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>From thence I paſs'd to the <hi>Cappa's,</hi> who gave me very good Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſome time after the <hi>Toginga's</hi> and <hi>Torimans</hi> receiv'd me with the like Demonſtration of Friendſhip and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Then the Courſe of my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney brought me to the <hi>Oſſotoues,</hi> where I built an Houſe for the Convenience of Traffick. There I ſpent five or ſix Days, during which, I made new Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaces, and encreas'd my Store of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. I departed from my Houſe in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> 1688. and after ſome Days travelling I got up again to the great Village of <hi>Taenſas.</hi> As we were purſuing that Journey, one of my <hi>Chaouanous</hi> being attack'd by three <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chouma's,</hi> kill'd one of them, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf receiv'd a ſlight Wound on the Pap, with the glancing of an Arrow. But a far greater Diſaſter befel us during that Journey. For two <hi>French</hi> Men of my Company ſtragling in the Woods to hunt, were aſſaulted by a Party of <hi>Naches,</hi> and unfortunately kill'd. We were ſo much the more ſenſible of this Indignity, in regard that 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to revenge it, not being
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98822:102"/>able to come up with thoſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <note place="margin">A quarrel between the <hi>Taen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa's</hi> and the <hi>Nachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toches</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Salt.</note>Upon our Arrival among the <hi>Taen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſas,</hi> the principal Elders of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inform'd me of the Conteſt they had with the <hi>Nachitoches,</hi> about Salt, of which, the latter would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer 'em to have any ſhare, and entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to be Mediatour for the making up of their Differences. I readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Office; ſo that Thirty <hi>Taenſas</hi> having joyn'd our Company, we arriv'd after Eight Days march, at the Village of the <hi>Nachitoches.</hi> This Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſtitutes only one State with two others, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Ouaſita's</hi> and the <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis.</hi> The chief Commanders of theſe three ſorts of People being met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they cauſed me to ſit down in the middle of 'em; but the Thirty <hi>Taenſa's,</hi> before they took their place, deſir'd Leave to go to the Temple, to implore the Aſſiſtance of their God, for the obtaining a firm Peace. (Here 'tis obſervable by the way, that the Sun is the Deity which is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ador'd among all thoſe People.) Therefore theſe <hi>Taenſa's</hi> were actually conducted to the Temple; and after having ſaid their Prayers, were brought
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98822:103"/>back to the Aſſembly, where they call'd their God to witneſs the Sincerity of their Intentions, as to the matter of Peace; made their Preſents to the three ſeveral Nations; and nominated me for Guarantee of their Treaty. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I promoted their Intereſt as far as it lay in my Power, making the beſt of their Claim, and at laſt brought Matters to a good Accommodation; inſomuch, that the <hi>Nachitoches</hi> promis'd to ſupply 'em with Salt, in exchange for their Skins and Grains. Upon the breaking up of the Convention, they took a reciprocal Oath to maintain Peace and an Amicable Correſpondence one with another, and danc'd the <hi>Calu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> according to the uſual Cuſtom of the <hi>Americans.</hi> Afterwards I took my leave of both thoſe Nations.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Nachitoches</hi> provided Five Guides to conduct me to the Village of the <hi>Yataches,</hi> and to go thither; I was oblig'd to paſs on the River <hi>Onoroyſte,</hi> about 30 Leagues. During our Courſe we found fifteen Cottages of the <hi>Naches,</hi> and took up our Lodging amongſt 'em that Night, continually ſtanding upon our Guard. The next day, having met with Twelve of 'em apart, we did not
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98822:103"/>ſpare 'em, but reveng'd the Death of our <hi>French</hi> Men, whom they had bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly aſſaſſinated. After having travell'd for ſome Days, we arriv'd in the Territories of the <hi>Yataches,</hi> who are united to two other Nations, that make three Villages together, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Yata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> the <hi>Onodo's,</hi> and the <hi>Choyo's.</hi> As ſoon as they had notice of our Arrival, they came three Leagues to meet us, and brought us good Proviſions for our Refreſhment. Afterwards we went out of the Champion Country to their Village, and the chief Elders enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd us at ſeveral Feaſts. Then I made 'em ſome Preſents, and deſir'd that I might have Guides to conduct me to the <hi>Quodadiquio's.</hi> They made a great deal of difficulty to grant me any, by reaſon that three Days ago they maſſacred three of their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors; nevertheleſs, by the means of Entreaties and Proteſtations to defend 'em, they were at laſt prevail'd upon to furniſh us with five.</p>
                  <p>When we drew near the three Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, we diſcern'd the Tracts of Horſes and Men on the Road, and indeed in the Morning divers Horſemen appear'd, and offer'd to convey us thither. I
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98822:104"/>was attended with 20 Fuſileers, well arm'd, and ſo in a Condition to keep thoſe Savages in awe. I had no ſooner enter'd the Village, but a certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who held the firſt Rank in that Country,<note place="margin">A remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.</note> made an Addreſs to me, and importun'd me to revenge her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Death, who was kill'd by the <hi>Yataches.</hi> A little while after another Woman came to me, to make the ſame Complaint, and they apparently were the Wives of thoſe Ambaſſadors, whom the <hi>Yataches</hi> had aſſaſſinated not long before. All the People ſeem'd to be concern'd at their Death; and foraſmuch as they were very ſollicitous about that Affair, I made a Promiſe both to the Widows, and to the People, to take Vengeance for the Murder of their Husbands and Ambaſſadors. Then they conducted me to their Temple, waſh'd my Face with Water, before they permitted me to enter; and after having pray'd to God for the ſpace of one quarter of an Hour, they led me back into the Cottage of one of thoſe Women, where I was magnificently entertain'd. There I was inform'd, that the Seven <hi>French</hi> Men, who were ſeparated from <hi>Cavelier,</hi> after the Death
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98822:104"/>of <hi>M. de la Salle,</hi> were ſtill living among the <hi>Nouadiches.</hi> I was extremely delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this piece of News, and hop'd to put an end to my Evils, if I could once find means to meet 'em again. Therefore having paſs'd the reſt of the Day among the <hi>Quadodiqui's,</hi> I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated 'em to furniſh me with Guides, and aſſur'd 'em, That at my Return I would either oblige the <hi>Yataches</hi> to give 'em Satisfaction, or I would require Blood for Blood at their Hands.</p>

Theſe three Nations ſpeak the ſame Language, yet their Aſſemblies are not conven'd by Villages, but by Habitations, very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote one from another. Their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are very fine, affording abundance of Game, and variety of Fiſh; but there are very few Oxen. Theſe People maintain cruel Wars againſt their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; inſomuch, that their Villages are not very populous. They all have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſine Horſes, which they call <hi>Cavalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o's.</hi> The Men and Women have their Faces prick'd, and even all the other Parts of their Bodies: And indeed the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98822:105"/>Fantaſtical Humours of Men is altogether unaccountable, ſince that which in look'd upon as Deformity in one Country, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for Beauty in another. Their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is call'd the <hi>Red,</hi> becauſe it actually throws up abundance of Sand,<note place="margin">The Red River.</note> which renders it as red as Blood.</p>
                  <p>I ſet out from thence <hi>April</hi> 6. <hi>A. D.</hi> 1690. with two Slaves, who were my Guides, for the Country of the <hi>Noua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diches.</hi> As we were travelling on the Road, we met with certain Savages of that Nation a hunting, who aſſur'd us, that they had left our <hi>French</hi> Men at home, which was very joyful News to me, but at the ſame time I had the Misfortune to loſe a young <hi>French</hi> Man of my Retinue: He found means to return three Days after, but without his Snap-ſack, where I had put the beſt part of my Proviſions, which created me a great deal of trouble. However, not thinking fit to take any notice of his Neglect, we took up our Quarters that Night within half a League of the Village of the <hi>Nouadiches,</hi> where the principal Elders came forth to meet us. I inſtantly enquir'd of 'em after our <hi>French</hi> Men, and they anſwer'd, that they were in good Health; but foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98822:105"/>as they were not to be ſeen, I could promiſe my ſelf no Good by it. The next day, being arriv'd at their Village, and none of 'em appearing, my Suſpicion was ſtill increas'd. The chief Governors of the Nation did not fail to offer me the <hi>Calumet;</hi> but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to accept of any thing at their Hands, till they had produc'd the <hi>French</hi> Men. When they perceiv'd that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in my Reſolution, they confeſs'd that our <hi>French</hi> Men having accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd 'em in the War againſt the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> were ſurrounded by the Horſe; that three of 'em were kill'd; and that the other four retiring to the <hi>Quoanan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino's,</hi> they never heard any Tidings of 'em ſince that time. I reply'd, That certainly they themſelves had murder'd 'em; they deny'd it ſtiffly, and foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as I inceſſantly accus'd 'em, their Wives fell a weeping, and made me underſtand by their Tears, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation concerning their Death was too true.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Nouadiches</hi> us'd their utmoſt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to clear themſelves, and offer'd me the <hi>Calumet</hi> a ſecond time; I told 'em that I would not accept of it, till I were thoroughly convinc'd of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98822:106"/>as to that Point, and that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs if I could be ſerviceable to 'em in any thing, they ſhould find my Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity inviolable. The chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander anſwer'd my kind Expreſſions, with a Preſent of Ten ſine Horſes, well harneſs'd, and I gave him ſeven Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets, with a Set of Glaſſes.</p>
                  <p>We left their Country <hi>May</hi> 29. and advanc'd within a Days Journey of the <hi>Palaqueſſons,</hi> where we were inform'd that the laſt Colony eſtabliſh'd by <hi>M. de la Salle,</hi> on the Coaſt of the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> not having been able to maintain it ſelf in a perfect Union, was quite diſpers'd; that ſome were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with the Savages, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers found Means to get to the <hi>French</hi> Plantations in other Places. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not judging it expedient to ſeek for 'em where they were no longer to be found, I took a Reſolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the ſame way I came. In the mean while I endeavour'd to paſs to the Village of <hi>Coroas,</hi> but a prodigious Inundation happening, by reaſon of the extraordinary Rains, which continu'd for Three Days ſucceſſively, we were involv'd in the greateſt Streight imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: For the Water every where
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98822:106"/>roſe up to the middle Leg at leaſt; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that we were forc'd to ſleep, and to make Fires on thick Trees, and we thought our ſelves happy, in being then provided with Caſſave, Beef and Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: We continu'd three or four Days in this forlorn Condition, but as good Luck would have it, we diſcover'd a ſmall Iſland, which the Waters had not as yet overflow'd, and we retir'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a Day and a Night: Our Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were ſomewhat recruited there, and the Ground being ſuddenly dry'd by the exceſſive Heat of the Seaſon, and of the Climate, we got up in a Days Journey to the Village of <hi>Coroas.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Coroas,</hi> a Savage People.</note> I cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently expreſs the noble Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we met with among thoſe People, who employ'd ſeveral Perſons every day in fiſhing and hunting, on purpoſe to treat us, and ſupply'd us with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Pullets, Geeſe, Pigeons and Turkeys. But that which redoubled my Joy is, that two of thoſe <hi>French</hi> Men, whom I ſought for among the <hi>Nouadiches,</hi> were luckily found here; and that I had so favourable an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to re-unite 'em to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:98822:107"/>
                  <p>I took my leave of the <hi>Coroas, July</hi> 20th. and arriv'd on the 31th. in the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of the <hi>Akancea's,</hi> where I was ſeiz'd with a Fever, which oblig'd me to ſtay there till <hi>Auguſt</hi> 15. After I had a little recover'd my Strength, I ſet forward again in my Journey to the Country of the <hi>Iſlinois,</hi> and arriv'd there in the Month of <hi>September.</hi> Thus the Treaty of Peace concluded between the <hi>Taenſa's</hi> and the <hi>Nachitoches;</hi> the pleaſure of being moſt kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by all the Savage People; and the Satisfaction of bringing back two <hi>French</hi> Men, whom I had given over for loſt; were the Fruits of my laſt Voyage.</p>
                  <p>By this Relation one may take an eſtimate of the Riches and Beauty of all thoſe Countries, inhabited by ſo many People, that are all in a manner already brought under Subjection, and who have a perfect Idea of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of our Monarch. It cannot be conceiv'd how much that Continent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, as well in all ſorts of Grain and Fruit, as in variety of Cattel. 'Tis ſurrounded on all ſides with great Seas, the Shoars of which are very deep, and ſeem to preſent us with natural
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98822:107"/>Ports; inſomuch, that three or four Havens on the Gulph of <hi>Mexico</hi> would undoubtedly ſecure for us the Poſſeſſion of thoſe Territories. The <hi>French</hi> are generally ſo well belov'd, that to make themſelves Maſters of 'em, they have nothing to do but to ſettle there incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently, and to plant their Colonies. What is wanting, may be tranſported thither by our Veſſels; as in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, what is wanting in our Country, may be brought us from thence. For from thoſe Parts we have our principal Stores of Skins; we might alſo get Silks, Timber for Ships, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commodities. If there be a ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Corn and Wine, 'tis leſs occaſion'd by the defect of the Soil, than for want of the Improvement of Husbandry. Laſtly, to procure all the Treaſures of Nature, 'tis only requiſite to beſtow ſome Pains in ſeeking for 'em, and to improve 'em when found. Such is the State of Affairs in that Country: God grant that a happy and laſting Peace may ſoon put us in Poſſeſſion, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us in the Enjoyment of theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Have at laſt receiv'd the Relation of the Voyage, made by Capt. <hi>Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Montauban,</hi> and I have ſent it you printed. You will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire without all Doubt, as well as I, how by the means of his ſingular Prudence and Courage, he extricated himſelf from thoſe weighty Preſſures, under which any other Perſon in his Circumſtances, would have unavoidably periſh'd: You may alſo call to Mind in reading the beginning of this Narrative, that you had a ſight of ſome of his Seamen at <hi>Bordeaux, A. D. 1694.</hi> from whence he ſet out the next Year to undertake the Voyage, of which he here gives us a particular Account.</p>
                  <p>He gave chace to divers Ships that he met during his Courſe, and engag'd at <hi>Cape Verd,</hi> with a Frigat of <hi>34</hi> Pieces of Ordnance. At St. <hi>John's Cape</hi> he came up with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel of <hi>20</hi> Guns, and took her after a ſmall Engagement. Afterwards he took a Caper of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:98822:110"/>and ſteer'd his Courſe to <hi>Angola.</hi> At last he diſcover'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Guard-Ship, arm'd with <hi>54</hi> Pieces of Cannon near the Coaſt, and fought her during five or ſix Hours, till they both came to board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with great Fury. But when he was juſt ready to maſter her, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſet fire to his whole ſtore of Powder, and both the Ships were blown up into the Air, with a moſt dreadful Noiſe and Havock.</p>
                  <p>You may have the ſatisfaction to take a view of ſo terrible a Shipwreck in this Narrative, as it were on the Sea ſhoar, and to obſerve how Capt. <hi>Montauban</hi> makes his Eſcape with Fifteen or Sixteen of his Men. He ſuffer'd Hunger above Three Days, and at laſt arriv'd at <hi>Cape de Lopez,</hi> where he went to viſit the King of the Country: He has given us a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Court and Kingdom of that Prince; treating at the ſame time of his Religion, and forming a Project for the eſtabliſhing of the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> in thoſe Parts. He ſtood Godfather to the King's Grand-ſon, by his Son Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> and embark'd in a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Veſſel, to return to <hi>Europe.</hi> An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man of his Acquaintance took him on board his Ship, and convey'd him to
<pb facs="tcp:98822:110"/>
                     <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> where he was confin'd in a Chamber by the Order of <hi>M. Ruſſel,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Iſland. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he was ſet at Liberty, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported to <hi>Martinica,</hi> where he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Death of <hi>M. de Blenac,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>French</hi> Iſlands. From thence he paſs'd over into <hi>France,</hi> and continu'd very doubtful thether he ſhould try his Fortune again by Sea or not.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Particulars (Sir) are related in ſo plain and natural a Style, that you may clearly diſcern the Integrity and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of the Author. Indeed it muſt be acknowledg'd that Sailers and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, taken up with the Management of Maritime Affairs, ate nothing near ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, as thoſe that have Employments on the Land, by reaſon that they do not keep ſo much Company, and have not an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of converſing ſo frequently with the more refin'd Wits of the Age; but to make amends for this Defect, they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally a great deal more ſincere. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you need not fear, leſt a Sea-Captain ſhould impoſe on your Credulity: Beſides, I have often heard him making a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame Voyage, yet never could perceive him to vary in the leaſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; inſomuch, that the Candour and
<pb facs="tcp:98822:111"/>free Air, with which he was wont to relate the bravest Actions that were perform'd in the Engagements, would ſoon perſuade his Hearers to believe, that what he ſaid was certainly true. Neither did he write this Narrative thro' Oſtentation, ſince he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſufficiently declares in the beginning of it, that he did it only to give an Account of his Expeditions to a Miniſter of State. Lastly, if you ſtill doubt of the Fight, in which the <hi>Sieur de Montauban</hi> ſuffer'd Shipwreck, you cannot but remember that you have read it in the <hi>Gazettes</hi> of the Month of <hi>September</hi> or <hi>October,</hi> of the preſent Year.</p>

                  <head>A RELATION OF THE VOYAGE OF THE <hi>Sieur de Montauban,</hi> Captain of the <hi>French</hi> Privateers, on the Coaſts of <hi>Guinea, A. D.</hi> 1695.</head>
                  <p>AFTER having been ſo often made ſenſible of the Malignant Influences of the Planet that governs at Sea; and having, by the means of a croſs For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, loſt all the Goods which I had gather'd together, with ſo great Care and Pains, I ſhould take no Delight in calling to Mind the Misfortunes that put an end to my laſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; were it not that the Deſire of being ſtill more ſerviceable to the Publick, and to Private Perſons, as alſo to teſtifie to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty the fervent Zeal I had for his Service, did not oblige me to ſet Pen to Paper, to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98822:112"/>give ſome Account of my Obſervations to <hi>M. Phelipeaux,</hi> in which he may diſcern with what Earneſtneſs I penetrated into the moſt remote Colonies of the Enemies, to deſtroy 'em, and to ruin their Commerce.</p>
                  <p>I was not willing to enlarge this Relation with an Account of all the Voyages I made, and of all the particular Adventures that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell me on the Coaſts of the <hi>New Spain, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena, Mexico, Florida, New-York, New-England, Newfoundland,</hi> the <hi>Canary Iſlands,</hi> and <hi>Cape Verd,</hi> where I cruis'd up and down above Twenty Years, having begun to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the practice of Navigation at the Age of Sixteen. I might alſo add the Expedition of the Year 1691. in which, being Commander of the Ship, call'd <hi>The Machine,</hi> I ravag'd the Coaſts of <hi>Guinea,</hi> enter'd the great River of <hi>Serrelion,</hi> ſeiz'd on the Fort of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in which there were 80 pieces of Cannon, and caus'd 'em to be blown up, that they might not be refitted: But I will confine my ſelf to the Narrative of my laſt Voyage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis the lateſt, and that which is ſtill freſh in Memory, as having been made known buplickly by the Report that was ſpread abroad in <hi>France</hi> and elſewhere, about the firing of my Ship, and the blowing me up into the Air, after ſo prodigious a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1684. after having ravag'd the Coaſt of <hi>Carrack</hi> I got the Wind to <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> and was inform'd there, that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of Ships was to ſet out from the Iſlands
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98822:112"/>of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and <hi>Nevi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> for <hi>England.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I was oblig'd to go to the Latitude of <hi>Bermudas,</hi> with a Deſign to ſeize on that ſmall Fleet, and in hopes of getting a good Prize. I was no ſooner arriv'd, but they appear'd ſteering directly towards me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of Fear; but I attack'd the Convoy, call'd the <hi>Wolf,</hi> with two other Merchant-Ships, laden with Sugar; the reſt having found means to eſcape, during the Fight. As I was carrying off this Prize, I met with another <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel of Sixteen Guns, that came from <hi>Spain,</hi> and was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſailing for <hi>England:</hi> She ſurrender'd after a ſlight Engagement, and I convey'd her to <hi>Rachel,</hi> where the Court of Admiralty adjudg'd her to me as lawful Prize. After having ſold her, I brought my three other Ships to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> where I arriv'd in the Month of <hi>September, A. D.</hi> 1694. Theſe were in like manner allow'd to be good Prize, and I immediately ſought for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to diſpoſe of 'em.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while my Free-Booters, who had not ſeen <hi>France</hi> for a long time, being now arriv'd in a great City, in which Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs and Luxury are predominant, were deſirous to make themſelves ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the Fatigues they had endur'd, during ſo long an Abſence from their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country: Inſomuch, that they rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly waſted vaſt Sums of Money, and gave way to all Actions of Extravagance. The Merchants and Victuallers made no
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98822:113"/>ſcruple to truſt 'em, or to ſupply 'em with whatever they deſir'd, upon the Reputation of their Wealth, and the Report that was given out in the City, with reference to the great Prizes in which they had a Share. Thus they paſs'd all the Nights in variety of Divertiſements, and the Days in running about the Streets in Maſquerade, cauſing themſelves to be carry'd in Chairs, with lighted Torches at Noon-day: This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Debauchery deſtroy'd ſome of 'em, and four others deſerted me; ſo that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that I loſt my Men, notwithſtanding all my Precaution, and all the Prohibitions that I could make, I determin'd to retire from the City as ſoon as 'twas poſſible, to preſerve the reſt of my Company.</p>
                  <p>At firſt I fill'd up again the Vacancy of thoſe that were loſt, by an equal number of young Men of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> who in a ſhort time were as capable of playing their Parts as the oldeſt. And indeed, I always take a particular Care to inſtruct my Men in the beſt manner of firing a Piece, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Exerciſe, with which I uſually train 'em up, within a little while, renders 'em as expert in ſhooting right at a Mark, and in handling their Arms, as the moſt ancient Free-booters of the Sea, and the moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hunters on Land.</p>
                  <p>After having victuall'd my Ship, which carry'd about 34 Pieces of Ordnance, I ſet out from <hi>Bordeaux</hi> in the Month of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, A. D.</hi> 1695. with a Deſign to cruiſe on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98822:113"/>the Coaſts of <hi>Guinea,</hi> in <hi>Africa.</hi> To that purpoſe I paſs'd to the Iſlands <hi>Azores,</hi> which lie in the 37th. Degree of Latitude, and rov'd up and down during Eight Days, without diſcovering any thing. From thence I ſteer'd to the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands, ſituated in the 25th. Degree, and deſcry'd the Pike of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriff</hi> at a very great diſtance, which is reput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the higheſt Mountain in the World. 'Tis reported that thoſe Iſlands took their Name from <hi>Doggs,</hi> call'd <hi>Canes</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> great Numbers of which were found there by the <hi>Portugueſes.</hi> I ſail'd round about 'em for Fourteen Days, to wait for certain <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſels, which (as I was inform'd) were to come that way; and indeed, they actually appear'd, but enter'd the Port be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could come up with 'em; which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment oblig'd me to ſteer my Courſe for <hi>Cape Blanc,</hi> and the Iſlands of <hi>Cape Verd,</hi> which lie between the 14. and the 18. Degree of Southern Latitude. Upon my Arrival, I met with two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships riding at Anchor in the Road of the Iſland of <hi>May.</hi> I ſent out my Shallop to diſcover 'em; and foraſmuch as ſhe brought me word, that they were Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers or Interlopers, of 30 Guns apiece, I took a Reſolution to take 'em by boarding; and therefore tack'd about, to make up to 'em: But whilſt I was running a Courſe on one of the Points of the Iſland, thoſe Veſſels did not ſtay till I had tack'd about again; but ſuſpecting my Deſign, they ſpeedily ſet ſail, leaving their Cables, Anchors and Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops on the Road.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98822:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>I purſu'd 'em all that day; but the Night approaching, I loſt the ſight of 'em, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Road, from whence they ſet out, to hoiſt up the Cables and Anchors, and to ſink the Shallops, to which they were faſten'd. Afterwards I ſteer'd my Courſe to the Iſland of St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> to pay my Ship, and to take in freſh Water and Wood. This Iſland is one of thoſe of <hi>Cape Verd,</hi> or <hi>Green-Head,</hi> where I ſtay'd Eight Days, and at the end of that Term, having receiv'd Information from a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Bark, that there were two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Privateers of 20 or 30 Guns at the Iſland of <hi>Fuogo,</hi> one of which was refitting, by reaſon of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement ſhe had with another Privateer, I immediately weigh'd Anchor, and made that Iſland, which is not very far diſtant from thoſe of St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> hoping to meet with the Enemies there; but upon my Arrival I was inform'd by the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> that they had left the ſaid Iſland <hi>de Fuogo,</hi> five Days before, in the Night, without giving any notice of their Courſe. Whereupon I ſteer'd mine to the Coaſts of <hi>Guinea,</hi> and touch'd firſt at the Cape of three Points, where I met with the Guard-Ship which was a <hi>Dutch</hi> Frigat of 34 Pieces of Ordnance, and was cruiſing on the Main. She did not fail to deſcry me, and forthwith ſail'd directly towards me, to make a Diſcovery: Foraſmuch as I alſo had a ſight of her, and wiſh'd for an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to fight her, I caus'd a <hi>Dutch</hi> Flag to be ſet up, to avoid diſheartning her, and to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98822:114"/>give her Liberty to draw near within my Cannon-Shot. When I perceiv'd her to be near enough, I put out the <hi>French</hi> Colours, and made a Signal co her to ſtrike Sail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> but ſhe incontinently let fly a Broad-ſide at me with a great deal of Courage and receiv'd mine in like manner. Thus we continu'd battering one another, from Morning, till Four a Clock in the Afternoon:Neither was I able to get the Weather gage, nor to come to a cloſe Engagement, to make uſe of my B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>anier Fuſees to good purpoſe, in which conſiſts the principal Force of our Privateers, nor to hinder her, by the means of the Advantage of the Wind, which ſhe ſtill kept over me, from caſting Anchor under the Fort of the Cape of the three Points; where there were alſo two ther <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War, one of which carry'd 14 Guns, and the other 18.</p>
                  <p>I was apt to believe at firſt, that thoſe three Ships would joyn together in queſt of me; ſo that I tack'd round about during a whole Day, to wait for 'em, and caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor within a League of the Road, hoping that at laſt the Shame of ſeeing themſelves inſulted over, after ſuch a manner, would excite 'em to endeavour to revenge the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front. But all theſe Efforts were in vain, and apparently the Guard-Ship was too much diſabled to ſtand in need of a ſecond Engagement. A ſmall <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Veſſel that paſs'd by ſoon after, gave me to underſtand, that thoſe Ships were the ſame, that had
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98822:115"/>oblig'd the <hi>Sieur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Roy,</hi> Commander of the King's Pink, call'd the <hi>Deep,</hi> to abandon the Coaſt, which was afterwards confirm'd by the <hi>Sieur Roy</hi> himſelf, at the Prince's I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, where we happen'd to meet.</p>
                  <p>Thus having perceiv'd, that the Enemies refus'd to ſight, and judging that in would be diſadvantageous to me to attack 'em un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cannon of the Fort; I took a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to go to <hi>Cape de Lopez,</hi> and to the Iſlands of the Prince, and of St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> By the way, I went to diſcover St. <hi>John's Cape,</hi> which is on the Continent of <hi>Guinee,</hi> as well as that of this three Points, and I lucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly met with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship of 20 Guns, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with 350 Negro's, Elephants Teeth, and Wax. It coſt me no great trouble to take her, and the Captain told me that he came from <hi>Ardra,</hi> where he took on board 550 Negro's, ſome of whom he caus'd to be put to Death, for revolting againſt the Ship's Crew, and others made their Eſcape to Land in his Shallop, which they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. <hi>Ardra</hi> is one of the principal Towns of <hi>Guinee,</hi> ſituated on the Sea-ſhoar, being the uſual Place of Reſidence of a Prince, who governs a large Tract of Land in that Country.</p>
                  <p>From thence I paſs'd to the Prince's I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, in the ſight of which I took a ſmall Caper of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> arm'd with Eight Pieces of Cannon, and 70 Men: She was wont to cruiſe in that Latitude, and to ſeize on ſmall Barks that paſs'd by that way,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98822:115"/>without any Diſtinction of Nation or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Afterwards I enter'd the Harbour, to cauſe my Ship, which was very ſoul, to be cleans'd, and to diſpatch the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prize, I had taken juſt before: I ſent her to St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo,</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> to be condemn'd there, under the Command of the <hi>Sieur de Nave,</hi> with a ſufficient number of Men, whom I took out of my own Ship. But I was inform'd ſome time after, that ſhe was retaken by certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men of War, who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the leſſer <hi>Goeree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while, not to ſuffer my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners to lead an idle kind of Life, I gave Orders to the Officers to cauſe my Ship to be careen'd, and with the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Caper I had taken, and 90 Men, whom I put on boards her, we ſteer'd our Courſe, during a Month and half, cruiſing up and down the Coaſts of <hi>Guinee,</hi> or round about the Iſlands of the Prince, and of St. <hi>Omer,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting any Enemy. Afterwards I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Road of the former of thoſe Iſlands, where I caus'd my Ship to be victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all'd with all poſſible ſpeed; and having made every thing ready, I weigh'd Anchor, and ſtood in directly for St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Iſland, with a Deſign to ſell or to truck away the Caper I had taken. And indeed, I barter'd her for Proviſions, not having a ſufficient Store to ſerve us whilſt we cruis'd along the Coaſts of <hi>Angola,</hi> where I determin'd to paſs five or ſix Months, to avoid a Privateer which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were building in thoſe Parts of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98822:116"/>
                     <hi>Guinee:</hi> They actually fitted out three Men of War and a Fire-Ship, to ſeek for me in the Road of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> where they judg'd that I was to continue for ſome time. At my departure from that Iſland I deſcry'd a Ship riding at Anchor, and making towards her, I gave her Chafe for a long time, but I could not by any means hinder her from getting a-ſhoar, and falling in with the Iſland of St. <hi>Omer.</hi> I mifs'd in not taking her 150 Pounds of Gold Duſt, which that <hi>Dutch</hi> Interloper had traded for on the Coaſt.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards I ſteer'd to the Coaſts of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gola,</hi> which are ſituated above 250 Leagues beyond the Equinoctial Line. I arriv'd there <hi>September</hi> 22. and got Information at the diſtance of three Leagues from the Port of <hi>Gabin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>la,</hi> that there were two <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Veſſels, laden with Negro's. Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as I lay under the Wind of that Port, I kept off from the Shoar, hoping that the next day the South-weſt Wind, that uſually blows from the Main, would convey me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly into the Port. That Morning, very early, I deſcry'd a Ship with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours making up towards me, yet I did not at firſt take her to be a Man of War, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd ſome time after, that ſhe carry'd 54 Pieces of Ordnance. I us'd all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution imaginable not to fright her away, and ſet up <hi>Dutch</hi> Colours to make up to her with greater Facility: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship on the other ſide did almoſt the ſame thing,

Having perceiv'd her Deſign, I feign'd to wait for her coming up ſteering very ſlowly, to induce her to believe that my Ship was over loaded, or that our Courſe was hinder'd for want of Sails, or a ſufficient Complement of Men. We paſs'd after this manner from Break of Day, till Ten a Clock in the Morning: She inceſſantly maintain'd her Flag with Cannon-ſhot without Balls; but perceiving at laſt that I did not do the like to make good mine, and that we were already come within Gun-ſhot one of another, ſhe let off a Cannon load with Ball, which oblig'd me to put out <hi>French</hi> Colours, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer her Salute. At the ſight of that Flag, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man of War, without endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to get the Wind of us, let fly two Broad-ſide, which I receiv'd without ſo Men kill'd: I ſtop'd that being come a little nearer, I might render her uncapable of making an Eſcape; uſing my utmoſt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to get cloſe within Fuſee-ſhot, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to embolden her to come on Board, ſince I was not in a condition to board her, becauſe we were to the Leeward. At laſt, having approach'd by little and little, and ſeeing her within the reach of my Fuſileers, who lay hid under Deck, I caus'd 'em to get up, and they made ſo continual a Fire, that they ſoon abated that of the Enemies.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98822:117"/>
                  <p>In the mean while, foraſmuch as their Company conſiſted of above Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men, and they were alſo ſenſible that their Deſign could not be accompliſh'd by the diſcharging of their Cannon, a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was taken to board us, which they did with hideous Outcrys, and Threats, to give us no Quarter, unleſs we ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd: But their Grappling-Irons not being able to lay hold on the Stern of my Ship, theirs ran in ſuch a manner, that ſhe daſh'd her Poop againſt my Boltſprit, and broke it in pieces.</p>
                  <p>Than my Men taking the Advantage of the Hurry and Diſorder, loſt none of their aim, and fir'd ſo furiouſly for an Hour and half, that the Enemy being no longer able to reſiſt; and having loſt many of their Mariners, began to deſpond, and retir'd underneath the Decks. I alſo perceiv'd almoſt at that very inſtant that they made me a ſign with their Hats to give 'em Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Whereupon I caus'd my Men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from firing, and commanded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to embark in their Shallops, in order to ſurrender themſelves on board my Ship. At the ſame time I appointed ſome of my Attendants to leap into that of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to ſeize on it, and to prevent all manner of Surprize. I was already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd at the taking of ſo conſiderable a Prize; and ſo much the rather, in regard that after having maſter'd that Veſſel, which was the Guard-Ship of <hi>Angola,</hi> and

                     </gap> better Prizes, and to attack any Man of War whatever: My Men were no leſs joyful than my ſelf; ſome of whom were going from on Board, and others were employ'd in veering the Cable, with a great deal of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, when on a ſuddain Fire, having taken the Powder in the Gun-room, by the means of a Match, which the Captain had left there, hoping to eſcape with his two Shallops; the Ships being grappl'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, were both blown up into the Air, and made the moſt dreadful Noiſe that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was heard. 'Tis impoſſible to make a lively Repreſentation of that ſad Spectacle; for ſince the Spectators were themſelves the Actors in ſo bloody a Tragedy, they knew not whether they ſaw it or not, and were not able to judge, but of what they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had felt: Therefore leaving it to the Reader to imagine the Horror that might ariſe from the ſight of two Ships that are blown up into the Air with Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, above the height of 200<note n="†" place="margin">Toiſes.</note> Fathoms, forming as it were an huge Mountain of Fire, Water, Fragments of the Ships, Cords, pieces of Ordnance and Men, with a deadly Havock; during which, amidſt the noiſe of the Guns that were let off in the Air, and of the roaring Waves that ſwell'd upon all ſides; one might alſo hear the horrible craſhing of the ſhatter'd Maſts and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, of the torn Sails and Cords; of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98822:118"/>Men crying out, and of the broken Bones, leaving all that I ſay to the Imagination of the Reader, I ſhall only declare here what befel my ſelf, and by what good Fortune I eſcap'd.</p>
                  <p>When the Fire took, I ſtood on the Deck of my Ship in the Fore-Caſtle, where I was giving Orders, and was blown up with ſome part of the Deck ſo violently, that (as I take it) the extreme Height, to which I was hurry'd, hinder'd me from being involv'd among the Fragments of the Ships, where I muſt inevitably have been cruſh'd in a thouſand pieces: I fell back into the Sea, quite ſtunn'd, and continu'd for a long while under Water without being able to recover my ſelf; till at laſt ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling in the Water, as a Man, who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of being drown'd, I got above it, and caught hold of a piece of Maſt that ſay near me. Then I cry'd out to ſome of my Men whom I ſaw ſwimming round about me, and exhorted 'em to be of good Courage, hoping that we might ſave our ſelves if we could find ſome of our Shallops. But that which troubl'd me more than my own Misfortune, was the ſight of two half Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in which there was ſtill ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of Life, floating on the Water, and leaving the Place where they ſunk ſtain'd with their Blood; as alſo to ſee round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me an infinite number of Limbs and Members torn from Bodies, and the greateſt part of 'em ſpitted on the Sprinters
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98822:118"/>of Wood. In the mean while, one of my Men having eſpy'd an entire Shallop amidſt the Wreck, that ſwam on the Water, told me that 'twas requiſite to endeavour to ſtop a Hole therein, and to take out a ſmall Boat, which was enclos'd within it. Whereupon about Fifteen or Sixteen of us, who had eſcaped, made up to the Shallop, every one on his piece of Wood, and took ſo great Care to clear our Boat, that at laſt our Attempt prov'd ſucceſsful. Thus we all got into it, and not long after ſav'd our Maſter-Gunner, who had one of his Legs ſhot off in the Fight. We took up three or four Ours, or pieces of Planks, that ſerv'd us for the ſame uſe. Then we ſought for ſomewhat to make a Sail, and a ſmall Maſt; and after having fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd our ſelves in the beſt manner we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could, we entirely rely'd upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, which alone was able to ſecure our Life and Safety.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon us I had ceas'd from Work, I found my ſelf all over beſmear'd with Blood that run our of a Wound I receiv'd in my Head, and which was apparently occaſion'd by my being blown up. There fore Lint was made for me with my Handkerchief, and a Band with a piece of my Shirt, having firſt waſh'd the Wound with Urine. The ſame thing was done for others of our Company, who were wounded, whilſt our Shallop ſail'd without any ſight of Land, neither did we know whither we were ſteering; but that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98822:119"/>which added to our Affliction was, that we had no Proviſions, and had already paſs'd three Days without either eating or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; inſomuch, that one of our Men, quite worn out with Hunger and Thirſt, drank ſo great a quantity of ſalt Water, that he burſt. The greateſt part of our Company vomited continually, whether they receiv'd any Injury from the Water they ſwallow'd upon their falling into the Sea, as if befel me, or from that which they were noceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to drink. As for my ſelf, I was a long time indiſpos'd, ſo that my Body ſwell'd extremely, and a great number of ſmall Pimples broke forth throughout my Body: But I am apt to believe, the cure of my Dropſie, and the Health that I have in ſome meaſure recover'd, and which is by degrees more and more reſtor'd, to be chiefly owing to a Quartan-Ague, that ſeiz'd on me a little while after that Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. I do not reckon up the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences that were occaſion'd by ſo deſperate a Blow, it being impoſſible that they ſhould not befal any Perſon under my Circumſtances. The Fire of the Powder burnt all my Hair, my whole Face, and all over one ſide of my Body, and I became ſenſible of that Accident, which commonly happens among the Cannoniers, who ſerve at Sea; that is to ſay, I voided Blood thro' the Noſe, Ears and Mouth. I know not whether the Blaſt of the Gun-powder pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces that Effect, by exceſſively dilating the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98822:119"/>Veſſels that contain the Blood in our Body, ſo that the ends of the Branches let it out, or whether the great Noiſe and Commotion that it cauſes in thoſe Organs, opliges the Veins to open: But let the caſe be how it will, 'tis of no great moment, ſince this is not a proper Place to hold a Conſultation of Phyſitians, as long as we are ready to be ſtarv'd with Hunger; nor to enquire what became of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, when we had much ado to ſave our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>We continu'd our Courſe by rowing up the Current, becauſe we knew it came from the Port of <hi>Cabinda;</hi> but foraſmuch as the Wind was contrary, we could never reach it; and we were forc'd to content our ſelves only to make <hi>Cape Corſa</hi> if it were poſſible, which is diſtan. Twelve Leagues from that of <hi>Catherſna,</hi> where we were not able to land, by reaſon of a Bar, which renders the Coaſt inacceſſible. That was our Deſign, but Hunger hinder'd us from putting it in Execution, and 'twas requiſite to overcome the Obſtacles that Nature laid in our way, by getting a-ſhoar notwithſtanding the Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which we did at laſt, with a great deal of Difficulty, hoping to meet with ſome Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro, who might ſupply us with Victuals. Therefore one of our Company being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach' to ſeek for ſomewhat to appeaſe our Hunger, had the good Luck to find in a Pond that the Sea had form'd hard by, good ſtore of Oyſters ſticking to certain Branches, and immediately ran to give us notice of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98822:120"/>this Diſcovery. Whereupon we all got up the Channel, to that Pond; and being arriv'd there, eat Oyſters with a very good Appetite; opening 'em with Knives we had in our Pockets, which we lent one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very charitably. After having ſpent two Daye there, I divided my Men into three ſmall Bands, and ſent 'em to ſeek for Proviſions and Habitations farther up the Land, with Orders to return to the Shallop in the Evening. I alſo went forth with the reſt, but we did not meet with an Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor any Footſteps of Men. We only ſaw many Herds of Buffies, of the bigneſs of an Ox, which fled from us as we drew near 'em . Thus the whole Day being ſpent, without finding any thing, we all came back to the Shallop to feed upon Oyſters, and took a Reſolution to depart from that Place the next day, to go to <hi>Cape Corſa,</hi> to the Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of which is ſituated a large Port, where the Veſſels that come from Cruiſing, take in freſh Water and Wood. The Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro's who inhabit the Country as ſoon as they are inform'd of the Arrival of any Veſſels, by the diſcharging of their Cannon, inſtantly repair to the Shoar, bringing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to be exchang'd for Brandy, Knives, Hatchets, and other Toys. They are oblig'd to take up their Habitation far from the Sea, by reaſon that all thoſe Coaſts are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Marſhy Grounds. We were no ſooner arriv'd at that Cape, but we heard a great noiſe made by the Negro's,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98822:120"/>who came to ſelf Wood to the Ships that lay at Anchor in the Port, and I made enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry among 'em, endeavouring to find out ſome of my Acquaintance: For ſince they had very frequently ſupply'd me with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Refreſhments, Wood and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in my other Voyages; I hop'd to meet with ſome Perſons that had Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of me; but altho I knew many of 'em, nevertheleſs 'twas almoſt impoſſible to perſwade 'em, that I was Captain <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban,</hi> in regard that I was ſo much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figur'd; and they all took me for an Impoſtor that deſign'd to impoſe on their Credulity. However, I took the Liberty to tell 'em in their Language, which I underſtood a little, that I was ready to ſtarve with Hunger, and that I entreated 'em to give me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to eat: But I could not prevail by any means whatever, and 'twas abſolutely requiſite for me to beg the favour of 'em to conduct me to Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> who is the Son of the King of that Country, hoping that he would call to mind the good Offices I had formerly done him.</p>
                  <p>At laſt I found means to introduce my whole Company into the Preſence of that Prince. We paſs'd at firſt thro the Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe Negro's, and began by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, to make ſome Impreſſions on their Mind; inſomuch, that they gave us ſome <hi>Banna's,</hi> which are a kind of Figs, longer than ones Hand. The next day we arriv'd at Prince <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Seat, but I was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98822:121"/>in ſo ſorry an Equipage, that I could not make him take any Cognizance of me, by all the ſigns I gave him, either in the <hi>Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Language, or in that of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> which he ſpeaks very fluently. Foraſmuch as in bathing with him one day, he had ſeen a Scar occaſion'd by a Muſquet-ſhot I had receiv'd in my Thigh; he told me that 'twas requiſite at that very Inſtant to know whether I really were Capt. <hi>Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban;</hi> and if I were not the Perſon, he would take Care that I ſhould loſe my Head. Whereupon he ask'd me whether I had not ſuch a Scar; ſo that after having ſhew'd it to him, he immediately embrac'd me, and told me that he was very much concern'd to ſee me in ſo deplorable a Condition. At firſt he caus'd wholſome Victuals to be diſtributed to all my Retinue, and caus'd 'em to be lodg'd in ſeparate Apartments, giving particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Negro's, with whom they were quarter'd, to take all poſſible Care of 'em. As for my ſelf, he retain'd me in his Court, and caus'd me continually to eat at his own Table. When I was a little refreſh'd, he acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with his Intention to conduct me to his Father, whoſe uſual Place of Reſidence was five or ſix Leagues diſtant from thence; that is to ſay, ten or twelve from the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoar. Whereupon I gave him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that I was very ſenſible of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he did me, with extreme Satisfaction, and humbly entreated him at the ſame time to give me leave to take my Free-Booters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98822:121"/>with me, and to beſtow on us ſome Pieces of Stuff to put us in an Equipage fit to appear before ſo great a Monarch: He condeſcended to grant every thing that I deſir'd, ſo that three Days after, we ſet out altogether in a large Canoo, and paſs'd up the River of <hi>Cape de Lopez,</hi> by reaſon that the Country is ſo full of Fenns and Marſhes, that one cannot travel thro' it by Land.</p>
                  <p>Upon our Arrival at the King's Court, in a Village, conſiſting of three Hundred Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, cover'd with Palm-Tree-Leaves, where the King keeps his Wives and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with ſome other Negro Families, that have obtain'd the greateſt Share of his Favour; a Lodging was provided for me in Prince <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Apartments, and all my Attendants were diſpos'd of in others. We found the Inhabitants making great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and Mourning, becauſe the chief Prieſt of their Religion, whom they call'd <hi>Papa,</hi> dy'd that very Day; and in regard that the Funeral Pomp was to commence, which is uſually continu'd for Seven Days, for Prieſts of his Quality. Indeed he was in great Veneration and Eſteem among thoſe People, who look'd upon him as a Holy Man. Foraſmuch as during the whole time of that doleful Solemnity, the King was in Mourning, and admitted none to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Audience, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> advis'd me to wait patiently, and not to ſtir out of my Lodging, unleſs it were to viſit his Majeſty, becauſe it was the Cuſtom of his Nation.</p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:98822:122"/>
                  <p>However, I could not forbear going to take a view of the Funeral Proceſſion, yet could diſcern nothing but a great Concourſe of People round about the Corps of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Perſon. In the mean while, I was well entertain'd by the Order of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> who was gon to ſee his Father. Indeed there was no want of <hi>Banana's,</hi> Elephants Fleſh, and River-Fiſh; but we had neither Bread nor Wine, nor any kind of Sawce, as it may be eaſily imagin'd. My Men were treated in like manner in their Apartments, during the whole time of our Abode in that Place.</p>
                  <p>At the end of Eight Days Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> came to us, and introduc'd as into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the King his Father; he is a portly Negro, of a tall Stature, well ſhap'd, and aged about Fifty Years; who, to do me greater Honour, upon his Son's Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, went out of his Houſe, on purpoſe to receive me, and advanc'd ſome Paces for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to meet me. He leant on four or five Women, who ſupported him on all ſides, ſhewing a certain Grandeur, after a very confuſed and odd manner. He was ſurrounded with a great number of Negroes, arm'd with Lances and Fuſees, which they diſcharg'd from time to time with very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Order: Many Trumpeters and Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers march'd before him, and at the Head of that Company were carry'd divers Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards, of the Colour of thoſe of <hi>Holland.</hi> He had no other Cloaths than a piece of Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Cloth,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98822:122"/>with white and blue Stripes, with which ſome Parts were only cover'd by ſeveral Folds made round about his Body.</p>
                  <p>He was pleas'd to make me ſenſible of his Amity and Reſpect for me, by many Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations; and having ſtretch'd out his Hand, told me, that 'twas the firſt time he gave it to any Man. When we were arriv'd at his Houſe, he ſat down at the Door, and caus'd me to be placed on one ſide, and his Son on the other. Then he ask'd me ſeveral Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions about the Grandeur and Power of the King my Maſter; and after I had acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that he alone at preſent carry'd on a War againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> (of whom his Majeſty had ſome knowledge, as having often ſeen 'em at <hi>Cape de Lopez</hi>) and that he likewiſe maintain'd it againſt the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> more potent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than the former, he told me that he was well ſatisfied with my Narrative, and that he had a mind to drink a Health to the King of <hi>France.</hi> Whereupon ſome Palm-Wine was immediately brought to him, which was not very diſagreeable to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and his Female Attendants ferv'd him with it in a large Cryſtal-Glaſs. As ſoon as he began to take the Glaſs, the Negroes and Negreſſes, who attended in great numbers, held up his right Arm, and continually kept it ſteady in the ſame poſture, till he had made an end of drinking. Afterwards a great noiſe was made with the Trumpets and Drums, and a Volley of Musket, or rather Fuſee-ſhot.</p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:98822:123"/>
                  <p>Then Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> ask'd me what was the Name of the King of <hi>Frande;</hi> and after I had made Anſwer that he was call'd <hi>Lewis the Great,</hi> he told me he was deſirous that I ſhould ſtand God-father to a Child he had, aged only ſeven or eight Months, and that I ſhould name him <hi>Lewis the Great;</hi> whereupon I could not forbear ſmiling a little. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd me likewiſe that at the firſt Voyage I ſhould make to his Country he would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him into my Hands, to be convey'd to <hi>France,</hi> and preſented to the King, for whoſe Service he deſign'd him; being well pleaſed that his Son ſhould be educated after the manner of that Nation, and in the Court of ſo great a Monarch. I alſo engag'd on the other ſide, that the very firſt time I ſhould come back to <hi>Guinee,</hi> I would not fail to put him in mind of his Promiſe, to the end that at my Return to <hi>France</hi> I might ſet before the King the greateſt Preſent that could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be made; namely, the Son of Prince <hi>Thomas. Pray aſſure him</hi> (ſaid that Prince) <hi>that I am one of his particular Frineds, and that if he ſtand in need, of my Service I will paſs over into</hi> France, <hi>with all the Lances and Fuſees belonging to the King my Father; that is to ſay, with all the Forces of the Kingdom.</hi> Then the King reſuming his Diſcourſe gave me to underſtand, that he alſo would take a Progreſs thither in Perſon, if it were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and immediately all the Negroes and Negreſſes made ſo hideous an Out-cry, that I was extremely ſurpriz'd: That Cry no
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98822:123"/>ſooner ceas'd, but the Fuſileers diſcharg'd a Volley of all their Fire-arms, the Trumpets ſounding, and Drums beating; and the Lance-men fell a running from one ſide to another backward and forward, with great Shouts; ſo that I could not chooſe but be ſomewhat frighted: And indeed, I did not know the meaning of that Uproar, neither was I able to recover my ſelf, till I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that the King drank a Health to the King of <hi>France</hi> a ſecond time, with the ſome Ceremonies as before; that; Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> pledg'd his Father, and that 'twas order'd that we ſhould all drink at the ſame time. Which being done accordingly, the King caus'd two Loaves of Wax to be brought to him, made me a Preſent of 'em, deſiring me to accept of 'em as a Mark of his Friendſhip, and afterwards enter'd his Houſe.</p>
                  <p>This Audience being thus concluded, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> conducted me thro' all the Quarters of the Village, where he went to viſit his Friends, and on the following Days we paſs'd to divers other Villages, ſituated farther up the Country at the diſtance of five or ſix Leagues one from another. Theſe People, the greateſt part of whom never tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd to the Sea-ſhoar, and conſequently never had a ſight of white Men, ran from all parts to ſee us, and brought us greater quantities of Fruit, and of Fleſh, of Buffles and Elephants, than we could eat. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants of that Country are not altogether like thoſe of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> being but of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98822:124"/>one kind, as alſo are thoſe of <hi>Cofala,</hi> near <hi>Zanguebar,</hi> on the Eaſtern Coaſts of <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia.</hi> The Negroes eat 'em with a great deal of Delight, and eſteem their Fleſh beyond any other: They make their moſt ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Feaſts with 'em, and thoſe who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to do us moſt Honour, preſented 'em to us inſtead of Buffles; on which, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs I ſet a greater Value.</p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch as they were not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the difference of Colour between our Complexion and theirs, they ſtroak'd our Faces with their Hands, to ſee whether the white Colour would paſs away; nay, divers of our Company had their Hands ſcrap'd with Knives, ſometimes even till they were hurt, yet we durſt not complain of that rough uſage: However, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> perceiving it, commanded his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants not to ſuffer 'em thus to rub and ſcratch our Fingers, and ſpoke aloud to the People that ran after us, telling 'em that all Foreigners were white, and that if the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes travell'd into other Countries, they would appear as ſtrange to thoſe Natives, as we did among them in <hi>Guinee.</hi> Nay, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſmil'd to ſee the Multitude continually running after us, as if we had been ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Animals; and I know not whether he were diſplea'd to ſee us thus peſter'd by the Importunity of the Negroes, or whether he might not take ſome Delight in obſerving the Sottiſhneſs of thoſe People: And indeed, I had ſometimes an opportunity to take notice of all their extravagant Fopperies.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:98822:124"/>
                  <p>At laſt, after three Days Journey, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with variety of Divertiſements, the Prince convey'd me thro' another Road to take leave of his Father. The King careſs'd me in a moſt obliging manner, according to the Cuſtom of his Nation, and made me promiſe to viſit him the firſt time I return'd to <hi>Guinee.</hi> Afterwards we embark'd in his Canoo, and arriv'd the next day at Prince <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Village, where he continu'd the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Entertainments, with which he was wont to treat us. Then he told me that he was deſirous that I ſhould perform the Office of a Godfather to his Son, and I comply'd ſo much the more willingly, in regard that I had an Opportunity of contributing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the making of a Chriſtian, and the ſanctifying of a Soul.</p>
                  <p>But foraſmuch as I doubted whether the Prieſt of the Village knew how to baptize, or remember'd the Words that ought to be pronounc'd in the Adminiſtration of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, I entreated the Prince to provide ſome of thoſe Prieſts who were in the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Veſſels, and he accordingly ſent for one to <hi>Cape de Lopez,</hi> who arriv'd two Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Chriſtian Religion was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd into that Country by the <hi>Portugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> altho' it be true indeed, that they do not maintain it therein as much as it is requiſite: But the Obſtacles that hinder the Propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, proceed without doubt from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of inhabiting an almoſt wild and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Country, where the Air and Proviſions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98822:125"/>are not natural to Foreigners: Therefore in order to its firm Eſtabliſhment in thoſe Parts, 'twould be expedient for the <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to have ſettled Habitations, or to build Towns there, to inſtruct the Negroes in the Articles of Faith, and Myſteries of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and to ſend Miſſions thither from time to time; which might be done with great Facility, by reaſon that thoſe People are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely docil, and very capable of imbibing good Principles, and of embracing any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that one would go about to teach 'em, ſince they have liv'd for a long time without any manner of Belief, or any <hi>Idea</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion. Theſe Negroes being thus converted to Chriſtianity, ſome of 'em might be ordain'd Prieſts, who might be furniſh'd with Rituals, and other Books relating to the Ceremonies of the Church, and a Catechiſm for the regulating of their Faith, till they were capable of reading the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It would alſo be requiſite to eſtabliſh a Biſhop in that Town, who ſhould take care to ſend Prieſts into the ſeveral Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Negroes throughout the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to cauſe Oratories to be built in the moſt populous Places.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Chriſtian Religion might be propagated in <hi>Guinee,</hi> and would be leſs lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be extirpated by the Wars that the Natives make with foreign People. A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation might alſo be effectually carry'd on among the Chriſtians, who reſide in the Kingdoms of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> and a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98822:125"/>Correſpondence might be maintain'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prieſts of that Nation, and thoſe of <hi>Guinee,</hi> to the end that they might aſſiſt one another in the Preſervation of Religion throughout all the Coaſts of <hi>Africa.</hi> Indeed Chriſtianity was planted almoſt after the ſame manner among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had a much greater Averſion to our Faith, than the Negroes of <hi>Guinee</hi> have at preſent. The Prieſts, who are to be found thereabouts, are not for the moſt part real Prieſts; not having been ordain'd by any Biſhop, and having only ſubſtituted themſelves in the room of thoſe who died in their Country: Neither have they retain'd any thing that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours never ſo little of Chriſtianity, altho' they perform may Ceremonies, and have ſome Appearance of the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>But to return to our private Chriſtening; upon the Arrival of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Prieſt, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Son was actually Baptiz'd, and nam'd <hi>Lewis the Great,</hi> according to his Father's Intention: A certain Negreſs of his Relations ſtood Godmother, and I my ſelf was Godfather. I was told that that Lady bore the name of <hi>Antonia,</hi> which ſhe receiv'd from the Wife of a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Captain, who held her at the Baptiſmal Font. Two or three Days after the Celebration of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, which was perform'd with all the Magnificence that could be expected among the Negroes; ſome of prince <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Guards, who were poſted, at <hi>Cape de Lopez,</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:98822:126"/>to give notice of the Arrival of the Ships, came to acquaint him with that of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel. Whereupon I entreated him to give me leave to embark therein, to return to my native Country, in order to my perfect Recovery from that illneſs, under which I ſtill labour'd. But he was not willing that I ſhould put my ſelf into the Hands of my Enemies; and deſir'd me to have a little Patience, till the Arrival of ſome <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> with whom he would readily permit me to go. However, he went to <hi>Cape de Lopez,</hi> to truck away Elephants Teeth, Wax, and Negroes, for Iron, Arms and Brandy, and return'd after ten or twelve Days, when he told me, that a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Veſſel lay at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor at <hi>Cape de Lopez;</hi> that 'twas requiſite to cauſe my ſelf to be convey'd in Canoos, to embark there; that he had recommended me to the Captain; and that I ſhould want nothing that was neceſſary for me during my Voyage to <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then I took care to get all my Men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, except two, whom I did not think fit to wait for, becauſe they had taken a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs into the Country for five or ſix Days, and I knew not where to find 'em. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we embark'd in the Canoos of that Prince, after having ſolemnly taken my leave of him; and being arriv'd at <hi>Cape de Lopez;</hi> I perceiv'd that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander was an old Acquaintance of mine, with whom I had contracted Friendſhip at the Iſland of St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> Whereupon I took
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98822:126"/>Ship with him, and three Days after, we caſt Anchor before the ſame Iſland; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of which ſhew'd me a world of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and did the like to all my Men, during a whole Month that we were oblig'd to ſtay in that Port. At the expiration of that time, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship arriv'd, which had been ſteering her Courſe on the Golden Coaſts. I ſoon got into the Acquaintance of the Captain, and at laſt we became ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friends, that I thought my ſelf bound in Honour to accept of the kind Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers he made me, He entreated me to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark with him, and aſſur'd me, that at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes,</hi> to which place he was bound, I ſhould meet with all the Supplies, neceſſary for the recovering of my Health; becauſe there were certain able <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Phyſitians, who were his particular Friends. Therefore I went on board his Ship, with all my Men, notwithſtanding all the Reaſons alledg'd by the Governour of the Iſland, to induce me to ſuſpect the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captain, who was without doubt one of the moſt courteous and upright Men of his Nation: He was ſo kind as to reſign his Cabbin to me, and to afford me all the Delights and Divertiſements that can be imagin'd, to mitigate the Pains I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd from time to time.</p>
                  <p>Ten Days after our Departure from St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> having loſt the Rudder of our Ship, we were oblig'd to ſet up a Maſt in its place, which was put thro' the Port-holes of the Gun-room, and we were forc'd to ſteer
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98822:127"/>with it, during the whole time of our Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which continu'd three Months. When we ſtood in for <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> our Proviſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fail, and there only remain'd what was ſufficient for three Days, inſomuch, that the Captain being much offended at his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcharg'd with my Men, order'd three quarters of their Allowance to be retrench'd; and as ſoon as we arriv'd in the Port, went to ſalute <hi>M. Ruſſel,</hi> who was Governour of the Iſland. He gave him a particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Engagement I had with the Guard-Ship of <hi>Angola,</hi> and was very much blam'd for bringing me to <hi>Barbadoes.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, returning to his Ship, he related to me every thing that was diſcours'd between him and the Governour, who forbid him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of Death, to ſuffer me to land: However, he did not acquaint me with the Prohibition, but contented himſelf only to adviſe me not to go a-ſhore, to avoid giving any cauſe of Suſpicion to <hi>M. Ruſſell,</hi> which Order I promis'd punctually to obſerve, not being ſollicitous to take any further Cognizance of a Place, which was well known to me a long time ago, and being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give the leaſt Offence to my Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                  <p>The next day, many <hi>Jews,</hi> who were turn'd out of <hi>Martinica,</hi> came to viſit me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Report of my Arrival; and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to be very much indiſpos'd and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd, they ſent to me divers Phyſitians of their Nation, who told me that I could not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98822:127"/>be cur'd, unleſs I were brought a-ſhoar, proffering at the ſame time to ſollicite the Governour on my behalf, to give leave, that I might be convey'd into a Houſe on the Port. Whereupon I drew up a Petition to <hi>M. Ruſſel,</hi> in which I entreated him to grant me ſuch a Licenſe, promiſing that I would not ſtir out of the Chamber that ſhould be appointed for my Lodging, only to re-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark, and to cauſe my ſelf to be tranſported to <hi>Martinica.</hi> However, the Phyſitians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were oblig'd to be my Bail, and I was at laſt conducted to the Houſe of one <hi>M. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Lewes,</hi> where great Care was taken of me during the whole time of my Abode in that Place.</p>
                  <p>Three Days after I was carry'd thither, the Major-General came to ſee me by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's Order; very generouſly promis'd me his Protection, and offer'd his Service, eſpecially to procure me any thing that might be neceſſary for the Reſtauration of my Health: Yet I was viſited from time to time by the ſame Major, and every day by a Captain of the Garriſon; who came not ſo much to enquire after the State of my Health, as to obſerve, whether I ſhould ere long be in a condition to be tranſported out of the Iſland. <hi>M. Ruſſel</hi> himſelf came in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ten or twelve Days after my Arrival, to know whether it were true that I was really ſo ill as it was reported: He alſo gave me a ſecond Viſit ſeven or eight Days after, in the Evening, and caus'd me to be remov'd
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98822:128"/>from the <hi>Jew</hi>'s Houſe where I lodg'd, to that of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant: He told me at the ſame time, that I ſhould be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated there than I had been at <hi>M. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Lewis</hi>'s; but the real Intention was, that I ſhould be better guarded, and that I might not have an Opportunity of diſcourſing with ſo many People. The next day he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to ſee me, and ask'd me how I lik'd my new Quarters. I heartily thank'd him for the good Offices he had done me, and to the end that he might not have cauſe to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect my Men, I entreated him to give Orders, that they ſhould be confin'd in the Cittadel, to prevent them from ſtraggling about the Iſland, and from making their Eſcape.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>M. Ruſſel</hi> told me, that he intended to do ſo; but that I ought to underſtand that they were Priſoners of War, as well as my ſelf. I reply'd, That I was not ignorant of it; and that I thought my ſelf happy in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into his Hands; but that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captain, who brought me to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> had paſs'd his Word that I ſhould not be retain'd nor any of my Company: That upon his Proteſtations of inviolable Fidelity, and the Offers of Service he made me, I ventur'd to embark, relying on the marks of Friendſhip, which he had already ſhewn: Then I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that my Requeſt to him was only to grant me my Liberty, and that of my Men, promiſing that I would ever be mindful of the Favour, either, in reſtoring the Priſoners whom I might carry off from the Iſlands, if I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98822:128"/>ſhould take up Arms again, or in paying him what Ranſom he ſhould think fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No, Sir,</hi> (ſaid <hi>M. Ruſſell</hi>) <hi>I will neither have your Ranſom, nor your Priſoners; for you are ſo gallant a Man, that your Misfortune and Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot but be pitied, and therefore on the contrary, I would entreat you to accept of Forty Piſtoles, of which I make you a Preſent, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply you with Neceſſaries.</hi> He gave 'em me in a Purſe, which without doubt he brought for that very purpoſe, and at his Departure acquainted me that he was going to give Orders, that my Men ſhould be got together again. The next day he ſent me two of 'em, who told me, that they did not know what was become of the reſt, and that they had Orders from the Governor to ſtay with me: I had the Liberty to ſend 'em abroad, to procure any thing that I ſtood in need of, and at laſt finding my ſelf ſomewhat ſtrengthen'd by the means of the extraordinary Care that my Landlord took of me, I acquainted the Officer, who viſited me every day, that I would beg leave of the Governour to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark in the firſt Veſſel that ſhould ſet out from <hi>Martinica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three Days after there arriv'd a Bark, which the Count <hi>de Blenac,</hi> General of the <hi>French</hi> Iſlands, ſent for the exchanging of Priſoners. <hi>M. Ruſſel</hi> gave me notice of its Arrival, and that I ſhould prepare for my embarking therein. Then I had the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to go to his Houſe to thank him for all
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98822:129"/>the Kindneſſes he had ſhewn me. He told me that he was ſorry he was oblig'd by the Law of Arms not to allow me more Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than I had, and that he entreated me to afford a favourable Entertainment to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men who ſhould fall into my Hands. Afterwards I went on board the <hi>French</hi> Bark, which was commanded by the <hi>Sieur Courpon,</hi> formerly an Inhabitant of St. <hi>Chriſtophers;</hi> but I could not regain any of my Free-boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, except thoſe two, who were ſent to me by <hi>M. Ruſſel,</hi> as I have already hinted.</p>
                  <p>We diſimbark'd at the Royal Fort of <hi>Martinica,</hi> and I repair'd with my two Men to the Town, to give a Viſit to <hi>M. de Blenac,</hi> who was feiz'd with the laſt Fit of Sickneſs, of which he died. I gave him a particular Account of all my Adventures, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him to be much ſurpriz'd to hear a Relation of ſo great Diſaſters. Foraſmuch as he was deſirous that I ſhould lodge in his Houſe all the time that I ſtay'd at <hi>Martinica,</hi> he made me every day repeat the particular Circumſtances of my Engagement with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship; and at laſt having found an Opportunity of conveying me to <hi>France,</hi> he ſent to enquire after the Captain of a Veſſel that was bound for that Kingdom, and recommended me to his Care. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd likewiſe to give me Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Letters for <hi>M. Phelipeanx,</hi> to procure me, ſome Employment; but the day before my departure, he fell into ſo great weakneſs, that he was no longer in a condition to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98822:129"/>write, and died that very Evening, <hi>June</hi> 10. Indeed I had all the reaſon in the World to be very much concern'd at his Death; for <hi>M. De Blenac,</hi> who was a Perſon of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Qualities, took delight in being ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to all Mankind; and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally had a tender Compaſſion for thoſe that were in a diſtreſſed Condition, or lay under the Preſſures of ill Fortune, as my Caſe was at that time: He always endeavour'd to be beforehand with 'em, relieving 'em in their Neceſſities, as ſoon as they came to his Knowledge, and made a voluntary Proffer of the Favours he was ready to beſtow, even before they could well be ſued for. In a word, he was a Man of an Heroick Courage, and a skilful Navigator, well vers'd in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritim Affairs; knowing all the Coaſts and Latitudes of the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> and highly eſteem'd by the King for his Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Jeſtice and Prudence, and for all the ſignal Services he had done the State, in matters relating to Trade, and the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Iſlands.</p>
                  <p>The next day after his Death, I went on Board the <hi>Virgin,</hi> a Veſſel of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> which was alſo built there, and after a few Days Paſſage; at laſt I arriv'd ſafe in the Port of that City, with many different and contrary Sentiments. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall bid adieu to the Sea for ever, having been ſo much diſhearten'd by my laſt Misfortune; or whether I ſhall embark once again to revenge the Indignities put upon
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98822:130"/>me by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> or whether I ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take another Voyage, to get a ſmall Eſtate; or whether I ſhall ſtay at home in Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, contenting my ſelf with the peaceable Enjoyment of what my Relations have left me. However, 'tis certain, that Maritim Voyages are apt to create in Men almoſt the ſame Paſſions as Gaming: For as the loſing Gameſter, notwithſtanding the ill Luck he has ſo often had before, does not believe that he ſhall always be unfortunate, but is ſtill egg'd on by I know not what Impulſe to venture farther; ſo we Mariners, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Diſaſters may have befallen us at Sea, are continually boy'd up with the hopes of meeting with a fair opportunity to indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie our ſelves for all our Loſſes. Upon the whole, I am apt to believe, that into whoſe Hands ſoever my Narrative may happen to fall, they will find it very difficult to give me Adviſe as to the Matter in Debate, and even to take it themſelves.</p>
